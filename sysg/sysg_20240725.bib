	abstract = {Polymer brushes have become a signiﬁcant focus of polymer research with the need for straightforward and versatile surface modiﬁcation. With the development of controlled radical polymerization from surfaces, new theoretical models, and sophisticated characterization tools, the resulting ability to control brush density and brush thickness gives unparalleled control over surface properties and functionality. By increasing brush density, a stretched brush conformation is formed as a result of constraining the cross-sectional area of that brush strand which thereby inﬂuences the interactions of molecules with the brush surface. The associated residual stress also gives polymer brushes properties distinct from an equivalent layer of coated polymer chains. Examples of uncharged and charged “grown from” polymer brushes, the eﬀect of architecture on physical behavior, and the inﬂuence of nanoscale patterning will be described. The use of brush surfaces in biology relevant applications will be discussed and include resistance to nonspeciﬁc binding, cell bioadhesion, their use as platforms for biosensors, thermoresponsive surfaces, and targeted protein binding.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous ice nucleation (HIN) on ionic surfaces is ubiquitous in a wide range of atmospheric aerosols and at biological interfaces. Despite its great importance in cirrus cloud formation and cryopreservation of cells, organs, and tissues, it remains unclear whether the ion-specific effect on ice nucleation exists. Benefiting from the fact that ions at the polyelectrolyte brush (PB)/water interface can be reversibly exchanged, we report the effect of ions on HIN on the PB surface, and we discover that the distinct efficiency of ions in tuning HIN follows the Hofmeister series. Moreover, a large HIN temperature window of up to 7.8°C is demonstrated. By establishing a correlation between the fraction of ice-like water molecules and the kinetics of structural transformation from liquid- to ice-like water molecules at the PB/water interface with different counterions, we show that our molecular dynamics simulation analysis is consistent with the experimental observation of the ion-specific effect on HIN.},

Various electric pulse patterns were emulated by PFM with ultralow energy consumption. The fluidic property of PFM enabled the mimicking of chemical-regulated electric pulses. More importantly, chemical-electric signal transduction was implemented with a single PFM.

Chemical composition and surface topography are the two key factors in the wettability of solid substrates. Applying external stimuli and exchanging counterions of ionic liquids and polyelectrolyte films are valuable approaches for rendering the change in surface chemistry and/or topography, and for driving the transition between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of surfaces. Through the combination of stimuli-responsive films and micro-/nanostructural surfaces, smart surfaces with reversible switching between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity have been achieved. As an important advancement in reversibly switchable wettability, this review briefly introduces ionic liquids (ILs) as on–off systems to obtain reversibly switchable wettability and then discusses in more detail the methods to induce the reversibly switchable wettability of surfaces modified by ILs, additives, or thin films. In addition to reversibly switchable wettability mechanisms, open problems and potential solutions are discussed (157 references).},

In this review some recent progress on the theory, synthesis, and swelling behavior of polyelectrolyte brush systems in different environments is discussed. The height of the polyelectrolyte brushes is studied as a function of the molecular weight and graft density on both planar and spherical surfaces. In addition it is elucidated how the brushes are affected by external conditions such as the ionic strength of the surrounding medium, the presence of multivalent or polymeric ions and in some cases by the pH of the contacting solution. Two more specific cases, the synthesis and characterization of mixed polyelectrolyte brushes and cylindrical polyelectrolyte brushes, in which charged polymer chains are attached to the backbone of other polymers, are described in more detail.},

We explore how the pH and the ionic strength affect the rearrangements in the NF brush structure upon phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the translocation of H tails in an individual NF occurs as a sharp cooperative transition below and up to the physiological salt concentration. Regularities of this process are reminiscent of the collapse-to-stretching transition in a cylindrical polyelectrolyte brush in a poor solvent. The effect of pH at physiological ionic strength is noticeable only in the acidic range and is more pronounced for a dephosphorylated NF.},

While these systems have been subjected to extensive theoretical and experimental investigations in particular in the brush limit, a number of important questions remain to be addressed concerning the electrostatic correlations and excluded-volume effects beyond typical mean-field approximations. In this work, we applied a nonlocal density functional theory (DFT) to tethered polyelectrolytes within a primitive model and examined the effects of salt concentration, polymer grafting density, and chain length on the polyion configurations, the mean electrostatic potential, and the distributions of both counterions and co-ions. Whereas the theoretical framework is directly applicable to arbitrary solution conditions, this work is focused on systems containing only monovalent ions so that the comparison can be made with the established results. Given the polyion chain length and grafting density, we predicted a smooth transition from the osmotic brush to the salted brush in response to the increase of the salt concentration. In the osmotic regime, the brush thickness is invariant with the salt concentration but grows with the grafting density. In the salted regime, the brush thickness follows the classical scaling relation H ∝ Cs-1/3 for long polyelectrolytes but noticeably, the magnitude of the fractional exponent declines as the polyion chain length falls. Linear relations between the polyelectrolyte chain length and the brush thickness were identified for both osmotic and salted brushes. Qualitatively, all these predictions were found in good agreement with experiments or with simulations.},

However, the combination of these interactions with the physical constraints on grafting behavior remains unclear and there is a remarkable difference in the density profile of grafted PB between PDFT and simulation. Herein, we propose a PDFT to study neutral and charged grafted PBs by incorporating the physical constraints of end-grafted PBs into the excess free energies due to intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. This PDFT has been successfully validated where the density distributions of neutral and weakly charged PBs predicted by the PDFT are in excellent agreement with the results of the Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, the significant contribution of grafting behavior to the free energy of PB systems is presented. Consequently, this work provides a powerful and accurate theoretical method to reveal the interfacial microstructure of grafted PBs.},

	abstract = {The structural responses of polyampholytes to various chemical stimuli are sensitive to the sequence of monomeric groups that bear positive and negative charges. A theoretical understanding is yet to be established to account for the sequence effects under diverse environmental conditions such as solution pH, salt concentration, and ion valence. As a first step toward delineating the underlying physics, in this work, we consider strong polyampholyte brushes with either a diblock or an alternating chain architecture and study their structure and swelling behavior in response to variations in salt concentration, ion size, and valency using a polymer density functional theory. As the salt concentration increases, an alternating brush displays a re-entrance behavior, characterized by an initial reduction of the brush height followed by a subsequent brush extension. The ion size effects become appreciable only at high salt concentrations, wherein a reduction of the ion size leads to an increased brush height. For a diblock brush, however, the brush height decreases monotonically with the addition of salt when the counterions to the lower block are significantly larger than the polymer segments. A re-entrance behavior is observed only when the ion diameter is equal to or smaller than that of the monomers. The nonmonotonic trend contradicts the so-called antipolyelectrolyte effect, which predicts an expansion of the polyampholyte brush upon the addition of salt. While the variation of the counterion size for the upper block generates a similar swelling behavior, the ion size has opposite effects on the degree of interblock association. These trends have been rationalized by considering the interplay of excluded-volume interactions with electrostatic and correlation effects. For both types of polyampholyte brushes, the salt effects become significantly more pronounced in the presence of divalent ions, with the alternating brush displaying a stronger dependence on the salt concentration.},

Here, we develop a theory by systematically including the electrostatic interactions into the self-consistent field theory for polymers to study the conformational behaviors of a single PE in poor solvents. As the backbone charge fraction of the PE increases, our theory predicts that the spherical globule (Sph) can either be elongated to a series of pearl-necklace (PN) structures or be flattened to two novel structures that have not been reported before: biconcave red cell and toroid. While the PN structures are stable conformations, the two fattened structures are metastable. We find that the cylindrical globule, the stability of which is under debate, is an unstable structure. The signature of the PN structures obtained by our calculation is less pronounced than that reported by other theoretical works due to the continuous change in the curvature from the pearl to the necklace, which, however, is in good agreement with the results from molecular simulations and neutron scattering experiments. In addition, our theory reveals different characteristics of the globule to PN transition: the transition from the Sph to the PN with double pearls is discontinuous, whereas those from adjacent PN structures are continuous at finite salt concentrations. Furthermore, we observe different scaling behaviors: the string width is not a constant as a thermal blob but decays as the backbone charge fraction increases.},

Here, we develop a molecular theory by systematically incorporating the self-consistent field theory for charged macromolecules into the dilute solution thermodynamics. The kinetic pathway is tracked without any restriction on the morphology of the aggregates. We find that protein aggregation at low salt concentrations is via a two-step nucleated process involving a conformational transition from metastable spherical oligomer to elongated fibril. The scaling analysis elucidates the electrostatic origin of the conformational transition: the fibril enters the screening region much earlier than the spherical aggregate. As salt concentration increases, the classical mode of one-step nucleation corresponding to macroscopic liquid-liquid phase separation is recovered. Our results reveal that the screened electrostatic interaction is essential for the existence of the metastable oligomer and its subsequent conformational transition to fibril. The theoretical predictions of the kinetic pathway and the morphology of the aggregates are in good agreement with the experimental observations of real proteins.},

The vesicle formed by a single PE is electrostatic in origin where salt ions play the role of surfactant. We demonstrate that the transitions from vesicle to both spherical globule and pearl-necklace are discontinuous; the latter involves a two-step nucleation with an intermediate vesicle-necklace state. We also calculate the full diagram of state and show the existence of a critical quadruple point that is uniquely determined for PE with a given chain length.

	abstract = {We provide an in-depth study of pseudo-spectral numerical methods associated with modeling the self-assembly of molten mixed polymer brushes in the framework of self-consistent field theory (SCFT). SCFT of molten polymer brushes has proved numerically challenging in the past because of sharp features that arise in the self-consistent pressure field at the grafting surface due to the chain end tethering constraint. We show that this pressure anomaly can be reduced by smearing the grafting points over a narrow zone normal to the surface in an incompressible model, and/or by switching to a compressible model for the molten brush. In both cases, we use results obtained from a source (delta function) distribution of grafting points as a reference. At the grafting surface, we consider both Neumann and Dirichlet conditions, where the latter is paired with a masking method to mimic a confining surface. When only the density profiles and relative free energies of two comparison phases are of interest, either source or smeared distributions of grafting points can be used, but a smeared distribution of grafting points exhibits faster convergence with respect to the number of chain contour steps. Absolute free energies converge only within the smeared model. In addition, when a sine basis is used with the masking method and a smeared distribution, fewer iterations are necessary to converge the SCFT fields for the compressible model. The numerical methods described here and investigated in one-dimension will provide an enabling platform for computationally more demanding three-dimensional SCFT studies of a broad range of mixed polymer brush systems.},

We address this problem by grafting recombinant NF tail protein constructs (NFL, NFM, and NFH) to functionalized substrates, forming phosphorylatable brushes of defined stoichiometry. Atomic force microscopy reveals that NFM-based brushes are highly extended, while brushes incorporating the much larger NFH are surprisingly compact even after multisite phosphorylation. A self-consistent field theory predicts multilayered brush morphologies for NFM and phosphorylated NFH brushes. Further experiments with designed mutants reveal that N-terminal negative charges in NFH repel phosphorylated residues to generate the multilayer morphology and that charge segregation in NFM promotes collapsed conformations, lending new insight into how NF tail sequence features determine protein brush conformation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Species transport in thin-film Nafion heavily influences proton-exchange membrane (PEMFC) performance, particularly in low-platinum-loaded cells. Literature suggests that phase-segregated nanostructures in hydrated Nafion thin films can reduce species mobility and increase transport losses in cathode catalyst layers. However, these structures have primarily been observed at silicon–Nafion interfaces rather than at more relevant material (e.g., Pt and carbon black) interfaces. In this work, we use neutron reflectometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to investigate carbon-supported Nafion thin films. Measurements were taken in humidified environments for Nafion thin films (≈30–80 nm) on four different carbon substrates. Results show a variety of interfacial morphologies in carbon-supported Nafion. Differences in carbon samples’ roughness, surface chemistry, and hydrophilicity suggest that thin-film Nafion phase segregation is impacted by multiple substrate characteristics. For instance, hydrophilic substrates with smooth surfaces correlate with a high likelihood of lamellar phase segregation parallel to the substrate. When present, the lamellar structures are less pronounced than those observed at silicon oxide interfaces. Local oscillations in water volume fraction for the lamellae were less severe, and the lamellae were thinner and were not observed when the water was removed, all in contrast to Nafion–silicon interfaces. For hydrophobic and rough samples, phase segregation was more isotropic rather than lamellar. Results suggest that Nafion in PEMFC catalyst layers is less influenced by the interface compared with thin films on silicon. Despite this, our results demonstrate that neutron reflectometry measurements of silicon–Nafion interfaces are valuable for PEMFC performance predictions, as water uptake in the majority Nafion layers (i.e., the uniformly hydrated region beyond the lamellar region) trends similarly with thickness, regardless of support material.},

Because the brush stimulus response resembles the ability of natural systems to react to environmental changes, responsive polymer brushes have been incorporated into a number of soft biomimetic structures. Nonetheless, the ability to design soft matter systems that recreate the complexity of life remains limited. Here, we survey the use of responsive surface-grafted polymer brushes to mimic biological function. We summarize various ways in which surface-grafted brushes respond to stimuli. Next, we highlight examples of biomimetic engineering that mimic specific biological structures, including molecular motors, ion channels, leukocytes, and leaves. Finally, we discuss recent studies that design brushes to generate lifelike behavior and interrogate their response under the non-equilibrium, spatiotemporally heterogeneous conditions in living systems. Specifically, we focus on hysteresis in the brush response, as one example of nonlinear response; slow diffusion, used by biological systems to maintain chemical gradients; self-oscillation, as an example of auto-amplification of stimuli; and patterned responsiveness, as an example of compartmentalization. This focus emphasizes the emerging need to rationally design the response of brushes for use as soft components in dynamic, life-inspired systems.},

Azide-containing species, namely, biotin and peptide nucleic acid (PNA), were then immobilized on the alkyne-containing copolymeric platform via CuAAC. The potential use of surface-attached PPgMAMPC in biosensing applications was shown by detection of specific target molecules, i.e., streptavidin (SA) and DNA, by the developed sensing platform using a surface plasmon resonance technique. The copolymer composition strongly influenced the performance of the developed sensing platform in terms of signal-to-noise ratio in the case of the biotin–SA system and hybridization efficiency and mismatch discrimination for the PNA–DNA system.},

	abstract = {A major obstacle in the development of highly sensitive electrochemical biosensors is the issue of electrode fouling due to non-specific adsorption of biomolecules on the electrode/sensor surface. The efficacy of such systems is also limited by the need for high densities of immobilized bioactive molecules on the sensor surface. Biomolecules have a natural tendency to randomly adsorb on solid surfaces, which greatly reduces the bioefficiency and biofunctionality of sensing devices. Polymer brushes have recently attracted considerable interest for generating molecularly defined surfaces for applications in nanotechnology, molecular biology, and biomedical sciences. Two main advantages of using polymer brush systems are the ability to mitigate non-specific adsorption and the creation of tailor-made surfaces to control the immobilization of bioanalytes through specific receptor recognition interactions. The use of polymer brushes allows the formation of uniform surfaces with controlled chemical architecture that exhibits good chemical and thermal stability. In this highlight, we use recent examples to demonstrate the role of polymer brushes in the development of sensitive electrochemical biosensors with low detection limits.},

	abstract = {Polymer brushes formed by identical macromolecules anchored at the solid-liquid interface may undergo conformational transitions resulting in formation of layered structures with abrupt variation of polymer density (”vertical stratification”) or in lateral decomposition that gives rise to nano-patterned interfaces. The intra-brush nanoscale segregation is governed by a balance of intermolecular interactions with conformational entropy of the brush-forming chains and may be triggered by external stimuli that affect the strength of the inter-chain interactions. Both vertical and lateral segregation in the brushes have important implication for applications of brushes for modification of physico-chemical and (bio)interactive properties of interfaces, as well as in biological functions of biopolymer brushes widely found in living nature. While the effects of microphase segregation in polymer brushes are well understood on the basis of existing theories, experimental observation and characterization of such structures using surface-sensitive techniques often remains challenging. Here we present an overview of the state-of-the-art in experimental work on high-resolution structural characterization of polymer brushes in relation to the existing theoretical predictions.

While the importance of chain charge and resultant electrostatic interactions in controlling conformational properties of IDPs is beginning to be explored through in silico approaches, there is a dearth of experimental studies motivated toward a systematic study of these effects. In an effort to explore this relationship, we measured the conformations of two peptides derived from the intrinsically disordered neurofilament (NF) side arm domain: one depicting the wild-type sequence with four lysine–serine–proline repeats (KSP peptide) and another in which the serine residues were replaced with aspartates (KDP peptide), a strategy sometimes used to mimic phosphorylation. Using a variety of biophysical measurements including a novel application of scanning angle interference microscopy, we demonstrate that the KDP peptide assumes comparatively more expanded conformations in solution and forms significantly thicker brushes when immobilized on planar surfaces at high densities. In both settings, the peptides respond to changes in ambient ionic strength, with each peptide showing distinct stimulus-responsive characteristics. While the KDP peptide undergoes compaction with increasing ionic strength as would be expected for a polyampholyte, the KSP peptide shows biphasic behavior, with an initial compaction followed by an expanded state at a higher ionic strength. Together these results support the notion that modulation of charge on IDPs can regulate conformational and interfacial properties.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play central roles in numerous cellular processes. While IDP structure and function are often regulated by multisite phosphorylation, the biophysical mechanisms linking these post-translational modiﬁcations to IDP structure remain elusive. For example, the intrinsically disordered C-terminal sidearm domain of the neuroﬁlament heavy subunit (NFH-SA) forms a dense brush along axonal NF backbones and is subject to extensive serine phosphorylation. Yet, biophysical insight into the relationship between phosphorylation and structure has been limited by the lack of paradigms in which NF brush conformational responses can be measured in the setting of controlled phosphorylation. Here, we approach this question by immobilizing a recombinant NFH-SA (rNFH-SA) as IDP brushes onto glass, and controllably phosphorylating the sequence in situ with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK2) preactivated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK). We then monitor brush height changes using atomic force microscopy, which shows that phosphorylation induces signiﬁcant brush swelling to an extent that strongly depends upon pH and ionic strength, consistent with a mechanism in which phosphorylation regulates brush structure through local electrostatic interactions. Further consistent with this mechanism, the phosphorylated rNFH-SA brush may be dramatically condensed with micromolar concentrations of divalent cations. Phosphorylation-induced height changes are qualitatively reversible via alkaline phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation. Our study demonstrates that multisite phosphorylation controls NFH-SA structure through modulation of chain electrostatics and points to a general strategy for engineering IDP-based interfaces that can be reversibly and dynamically modulated by enzymes.},

We collect strong evidence that the electrostatic interactions are a dominant force that controls the NF brush structure. There exists a remarkable spatial separation of the H, M, and L tails. In a dephosphorylated NF we found conﬁned and ﬂowerlike conformations for the H and M projection domains, respectively.

A coarse-grained multiblock charged macromolecular model is developed to capture the chemical identity of amino acid sequences. For neurofilament heavy (NFH) brushes at pH 2.4, we predict three morphological regimes: swollen brushes, condensed brushes, and coexisting brushes, which consist of both a dense inner layer and a diffuse outer layer. The brush height predicted by our theory is in good agreement with the experimental data for a wide range of ionic strengths. The dramatic height decrease is a result of the electrostatic screening-induced transition from the overlapping state to the isolated state of the coexisting brushes. We also studied the evolution of the scattering and mechanical responses accompanying the morphological change. The oscillation in the reflectivity spectra characterizes the existence and microstructure of the inner condensed layer, whereas the shoulder in the force spectra signifies a swollen morphology.},

The structure of a globule and its melting thermodynamics is examined using the self-consistent filed theory. Our results show that the chain conformation involves three states prior to the globule-to-coil transition: the fully collapsed globule, the swollen globule, and the molten globule, which are distinguished by the core density and the interfacial thickness. By examining the chain-length dependence of the melting of the swollen globule, we find universal scaling behavior in the chain properties near the Θ point. The information on density profile and free energy of the globule is used in the dilute solution thermodynamics to study the phase equilibrium of polymer solution. Our results show different scaling behavior of the solubility of polymers in the dilute solution compared to the F–H theory, both in the χ dependence and in the chain-length dependence. From the perspectives of single chain structure and solution thermodynamics, our results verify the consistency of the Θ point defined by different criteria in the limit of infinite chain length: the disappearance of the effective two-body interaction, the abrupt change in chain size, and the critical point in the phase diagram of the polymer solution. Our results show χΘ = 0.5 (for the case of equal monomer and solvent volume), which coincides with the value predicted from the F–H theory.},

The properties of these polymers in solutions and at charged surfaces depend on the fraction of dissociated ionic groups, solvent quality for polymer backbone, solution dielectric constant, salt concentration, and polymer–substrate interactions. In this review, we summarize the current development of theoretical models describing properties of polyelectrolyte solutions and adsorption of charged polymers at surfaces and interfaces. We discuss in detail the conformational properties of polyelectrolyte chains in dilute and semidilute solutions, the phenomenon of counterion condensation, the necklace structure of polyelectrolytes in poor solvent conditions for polymer backbone, the dynamics of polyelectrolyte solutions, the surface overcharging by adsorbed polyelectrolytes and its implication for assembled polyelectrolyte multilayers.},

	abstract = {Many interesting physical, chemical and biological phenomena occur at interfaces between nanometre-scale layers of soft condensed matter. These often complex systems lend themselves to be studied by X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and neutron reflectivity (NR). The application of these techniques to such systems is extremely widespread and provides unique insights into their structure and dynamics. This review presents a snapshot of recent activity in this research area and identifies trends in the application of XRR and NR to novel, unusual or highly complex sample systems. Although the majority of research using these techniques is investigating variations on ‘traditional’ systems, supported by progress in instrumentation, advance sample environment and computational tools, NR and XRR have begun to produce singular insights into areas such as atmospheric science, real biological systems (cells and bacteria), oil–water interfaces or industrial problems (rheology, packaging or durability of nanomaterials).},
