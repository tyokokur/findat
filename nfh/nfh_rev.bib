	abstract = {The aim of the present investigation is to determine the effect of α-helical propensity and sidechain hydrophobicity on the stability of amphipathic α-helices. Accordingly, a series of 18-residue amphipathic α-helical peptides has been synthesized as a model system where all 20 amino acid residues were substituted on the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic α-helix. In these experiments, all three parameters (sidechain hydrophobicity, α-helical propensity and helix stability) were measured on the same set of peptide analogues. For these peptide analogues that differ by only one amino acid residue, there was a 0.96 kcal/mole difference in α-helical propensity between the most (Ala) and the least (Gly) α-helical analogue, a 12.1-minute difference between the most (Phe) and the least (Asp) retentive analogue on the reversed-phase column, and a 32.3°C difference in melting temperatures between the most (Leu) and the least (Asp) stable analogue. The results show that the hydrophobicity and α-helical propensity of an amino acid sidechain are not correlated with each other, but each contributes to the stability of the amphipathic α-helix. More importantly, the combined effects of α-helical propensity and sidechain hydrophobicity at a ratio of about 2:1 had optimal correlation with α-helix stability. These results suggest that both α-helical propensity and sidechain hydrophobicity should be taken into consideration in the design of α-helical proteins with the desired stability.},

	abstract = {Membraneless organelles important to intracellular compartmentalization have recently been shown to comprise assemblies of proteins which undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, many proteins involved in this phase separation are at least partially disordered. The molecular mechanism and the sequence determinants of this process are challenging to determine experimentally owing to the disordered nature of the assemblies, motivating the use of theoretical and simulation methods. This work advances a computational framework for conducting simulations of LLPS with residue-level detail, and allows for the determination of phase diagrams and coexistence densities of proteins in the two phases. The model includes a short-range contact potential as well as a simplified treatment of electrostatic energy. Interaction parameters are optimized against experimentally determined radius of gyration data for multiple unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). These models are applied to two systems which undergo LLPS: the low complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS and the DEAD-box helicase protein LAF-1. We develop a novel simulation method to determine thermodynamic phase diagrams as a function of the total protein concentration and temperature. We show that the model is capable of capturing qualitative changes in the phase diagram due to phosphomimetic mutations of FUS and to the presence or absence of the large folded domain in LAF-1. We also explore the effects of chain-length, or multivalency, on the phase diagram, and obtain results consistent with Flory-Huggins theory for polymers. Most importantly, the methodology presented here is flexible so that it can be easily extended to other pair potentials, be used with other enhanced sampling methods, and may incorporate additional features for biological systems of interest.},
