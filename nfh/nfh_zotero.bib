	abstract = {Multicomponent mass-transport in cation-exchange membranes involves the movement of multiple species whose motion is coupled one to another. This phenomenon mediates the performance of numerous electrochemical and water purification technologies. This work presents and validates against experiment a mathematical model for multicomponent mass transport in phase-separated cation-exchange membranes (e.g., perfluorinated sulfonic-acid ionomers). Stefan-Maxwell-Onsager theory describes concentrated-solution transport. Hydrodynamic theory provides constitutive relations for the solute/solvent, solute/membrane, and solvent/membrane friction coefficients. Classical porous-medium theories scale membrane tortuosity. Electrostatic relaxation creates friction between ions. The model uses calculated ion and solvent partitioning between the external solution and the membrane from Part I of this series and incorporates the corresponding ion speciation into the transport coefficients. The proposed transport model compares favorably to properties (e.g., membrane conductivity, transference numbers, electroosmosis, and permeability) measured in dilute and concentrated aqueous binary and ternary electrolytes. The results reveal that the concentration and type of ions in the external solution alter the solvent volume fraction and viscosity in the hydrophilic pathways of the membrane, changing macroscale ionomer conductivity, permeability, and transference numbers. This work provides a physicochemical framework to predict ion-exchange-membrane performance in multicomponent systems exhibiting coupled transport.},

	abstract = {The Equilibrium Theory of Inhomogeneous Polymers provides an introduction to the field-theoretic methods and computer simulation techniques that are used in the design of structured polymeric fluids. By such methods, the principles that dictate equilibrium self-assembly in systems ranging from block and graft copolymers, to polyelectrolytes, liquid crystalline polymers, and polymer nanocomposites can be established. Building on an introductory discussion of single-polymerstatistical mechanics, the book provides a detailed treatment of analytical and numerical techniques for addressing the conformational properties of polymers subjected to spatially-varying potential fields. This problem is shown to be central to the field-theoretic description of interacting polymericfluids, and models for a number of important polymer systems are elaborated. Chapter 5 serves to unify and expound the topic of self-consistent field theory, which is a collection of analytical and numerical techniques for obtaining solutions of polymer field theory models in the mean-field approximation. The concluding Chapter 6 provides a discussion of analytical methods for going beyond the mean-field approximation and an introduction to the exciting new field of field-theoretic polymersimulations - the direct numerical simulation of polymer field theory models. No other book brings together in such a detailed and instructive fashion the theoretical and numerical tools for investigating the equilibrium structure and thermodynamics of meso-structured polymer formulations, includingthose relevant to soft material nanotechnologies, personal care products, and multiphase plastic materials.},

	abstract = {Responsive or smart polymer brushes undergo pronounced changes in their surface properties and conformation in response to changes in their environment, including variation in temperature, solution pH or ionic strength, and presence of light. Because the brush stimulus response resembles the ability of natural systems to react to environmental changes, responsive polymer brushes have been incorporated into a number of soft biomimetic structures. Nonetheless, the ability to design soft matter systems that recreate the complexity of life remains limited. Here, we survey the use of responsive surface-grafted polymer brushes to mimic biological function. We summarize various ways in which surface-grafted brushes respond to stimuli. Next, we highlight examples of biomimetic engineering that mimic specific biological structures, including molecular motors, ion channels, leukocytes, and leaves. Finally, we discuss recent studies that design brushes to generate lifelike behavior and interrogate their response under the non-equilibrium, spatiotemporally heterogeneous conditions in living systems. Specifically, we focus on hysteresis in the brush response, as one example of nonlinear response; slow diffusion, used by biological systems to maintain chemical gradients; self-oscillation, as an example of auto-amplification of stimuli; and patterned responsiveness, as an example of compartmentalization. This focus emphasizes the emerging need to rationally design the response of brushes for use as soft components in dynamic, life-inspired systems.},

	abstract = {Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations using explicit solvent models were performed to understand Nafion ionomer morphology in 1-propanol (NPA)/water solutions under various conditions (ionomer concentration, NPA/water fraction, and salt addition). The self-assembly behavior of ionomers into a cylindrical aggregate with a diameter of ∼2–3 nm was observed. At low ionomer concentration (≤5.0 wt \%), the ionomer aggregate becomes smaller in size and thinner with increasing NPA fractions. At high ionomer concentration (7.5 wt \%), the size of aggregates in a longitudinal direction increases significantly at high NPA fractions, suggesting that excess addition of NPA does not necessarily contribute to the dispersivity of ionomers, particularly at high ionomer concentration. These nonmonotonic behaviors of ionomer aggregation are controlled by the electrostatic repulsion among the sulfonate groups, which is determined by the balance among the dielectric constants of solvents, the distribution of hydronium ions, and the surface density of sulfonate groups. Upon the addition of salts, the size of aggregates increases significantly, and the formation of a larger disk-shaped aggregate and a secondary aggregate of multiple bundles for low and high NPA contents, respectively, was found.},

	abstract = {DNA in living cells is generally processed via the generation and the protection of single-stranded DNA involving the binding of ssDNA-binding proteins (SSBs). The studies of SSB-binding mode transition and cooperativity are therefore critical to many cellular processes like DNA repair and replication. However, only a few atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations of ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments have been conducted so far. The point is that adsorption of ssDN A–SSB complexes on mica, necessary for AFM imaging, is not an easy task. Here, we addressed this issue by using spermidine as a binding agent. This trivalent cation induces a stronger adsorption on mica than divalent cations, which are commonly used by AFM users but are ineffective in the adsorption of ssDNA–SSB complexes. At low spermidine concentration (\&lt;0.3 mM), we obtained AFM images of ssDNA–SSB complexes (E. coli SSB, gp32 and yRPA) on mica at both low and high ionic strengths. In addition, partially or fully saturated nucleoprotein filaments were studied at various monovalent salt concentrations thus allowing the observation of SSB-binding mode transition. In association with conventional biochemical techniques, this work should make it possible to study the dynamics of DNA processes involving DNA–SSB complexes as intermediates by AFM.},

Analysis of high-resolution AFM images allowed their classification based on the periodicity of these features. A major species is identified with periodic features of 4.3 nm displaying left-handed ridges or zigzag features on the molecular surface. A minor species shows primarily left-handed periodic features of 2.2 nm. In addition to 4.3 and 2.2 nm ridges, background features with periodicity of 0.9 nm are also observed. Using molecular modeling and simulation, we identify a molecular structure that can explain both the periodicity and handedness of the major G-wire species.

Scaling analysis is combined with extensive numerical self-consistent-field (SCF) calculations performed on the basis of an extended Scheutjens-Fleer (SF) algorithm. We demonstrate that the predictions of scaling analysis are applicable only for starburst polyelectrolytes with relatively small number of generations and sufficiently long spacers. We prove that irrespective of the strength/type of the intramolecular interactions the starburst macromolecules are characterized by a monotonic decay of the density profiles in the radial direction. In the case of a large number of generations a quasi-plateau in the monomer density profile is observed. This leveled-off distribution of density is due to strong fluctuations in the radial positions of branching points and end segments. In accordance with earlier Monte Carlo simulations results, we observe that the outer generations pull strongly on the spacers of inner generations.

We explore how the pH and the ionic strength affect the rearrangements in the NF brush structure upon phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the translocation of H tails in an individual NF occurs as a sharp cooperative transition below and up to the physiological salt concentration. Regularities of this process are reminiscent of the collapse-to-stretching transition in a cylindrical polyelectrolyte brush in a poor solvent. The effect of pH at physiological ionic strength is noticeable only in the acidic range and is more pronounced for a dephosphorylated NF.},

	abstract = {Polymer brushes formed by identical macromolecules anchored at the solid-liquid interface may undergo conformational transitions resulting in formation of layered structures with abrupt variation of polymer density (”vertical stratification”) or in lateral decomposition that gives rise to nano-patterned interfaces. The intra-brush nanoscale segregation is governed by a balance of intermolecular interactions with conformational entropy of the brush-forming chains and may be triggered by external stimuli that affect the strength of the inter-chain interactions. Both vertical and lateral segregation in the brushes have important implication for applications of brushes for modification of physico-chemical and (bio)interactive properties of interfaces, as well as in biological functions of biopolymer brushes widely found in living nature. While the effects of microphase segregation in polymer brushes are well understood on the basis of existing theories, experimental observation and characterization of such structures using surface-sensitive techniques often remains challenging. Here we present an overview of the state-of-the-art in experimental work on high-resolution structural characterization of polymer brushes in relation to the existing theoretical predictions. The review focusses on planar and spherical brushes. Moreover, consequences for the related case of bottle brush polymers are discussed.},

With the development of controlled radical polymerization from surfaces, new theoretical models, and sophisticated characterization tools, the resulting ability to control brush density and brush thickness gives unparalleled control over surface properties and functionality. By increasing brush density, a stretched brush conformation is formed as a result of constraining the cross-sectional area of that brush strand which thereby inﬂuences the interactions of molecules with the brush surface. The associated residual stress also gives polymer brushes properties distinct from an equivalent layer of coated polymer chains. Examples of uncharged and charged “grown from” polymer brushes, the eﬀect of architecture on physical behavior, and the inﬂuence of nanoscale patterning will be described. The use of brush surfaces in biology relevant applications will be discussed and include resistance to nonspeciﬁc binding, cell bioadhesion, their use as platforms for biosensors, thermoresponsive surfaces, and targeted protein binding.},

We extend previous work on polyelectrolyte brushes and find evidence for a structural phase transition caused by internal phase separation in the polyelectrolyte brush upon a decrease of the solvent quality. In the limit of long chains, when a local electroneutrality approximation is exact, we find that the transition in the brush is continuous and tends to be second order. In the numerical calculations which employ the full Poisson-Boltzmann equation, a parameter window is found in which the structural phase transition is first-order. This is proven by the existence of a hysteresis loop in various properties of the brush, such as the degree of dissociation, the average height, the electrostatic potential profile, and the overall and end segmentdensity profiles. Apart from this difference as to the order of the transition, we find extremely good correspondence between the numerical calculations and the analytical asymptotic analysis for long polymer chains. The structure of the internally phase-separated layer is characterized by a condensed phase near the surface, a dilute swollen layer extending far into solution, and a thin interface between the two regions.},

The theory clarifies the nature of the first-order transition initiating the ordering and predicts the effect of the chain length, N, on the transition point and on the size of the critical nucleus of the ordered phase. For bidisperse brushes composed of chains of two fractions differing in contour length, the theory explains two mechanisms of ordering observed by self-consistentfield computer modeling and gives predictions for certain important features of the ordering (character of transitions, shifts of the transition points, and parameter domains of ordering mechanisms). Predictions of the analytical theory are in good agreement with the results of SCF computer modeling.},

Here, we review how NFs provide structural support for the highly asymmetric geometries of neurons and, especially, for the marked radial expansion of myelinated axons crucial for effective nerve conduction velocity. NFs in axons extensively cross-bridge and interconnect with other non-IF components of the cytoskeleton, including microtubules, actin filaments, and other fibrous cytoskeletal elements, to establish a regionally specialized network that undergoes exceptionally slow local turnover and serves as a docking platform to organize other organelles and proteins. We also discuss how a small pool of oligomeric and short filamentous precursors in the slow phase of axonal transport maintains this network. A complex pattern of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events on each subunit modulates filament assembly, turnover, and organization within the axonal cytoskeleton. Multiple factors, and especially turnover rate, determine the size of the network, which can vary substantially along the axon. NF gene mutations cause several neuroaxonal disorders characterized by disrupted subunit assembly and NF aggregation. Additional NF alterations are associated with varied neuropsychiatric disorders. New evidence that subunits of NFs exist within postsynaptic terminal boutons and influence neurotransmission suggests how NF proteins might contribute to normal synaptic function and neuropsychiatric disease states.},

Although the actual amino-acid sequences in the projection domains are coarse-grained, the different (realistic) solubilities of amino-acid residues and the speciﬁc distribution of its intrinsic charges inside the arms of the NF proteins are taken explicitly into account. We collect strong evidence that the electrostatic interactions are a dominant force that controls the NF brush structure. There exists a remarkable spatial separation of the H, M, and L tails. In a dephosphorylated NF we found conﬁned and ﬂowerlike conformations for the H and M projection domains, respectively. We demonstrate that the ionization of KSP repeats in NF proteins triggers a conformational transition in the H tail that leads to the expulsion of its terminal (KEP) domain to the periphery of the NF brush. We argue that the phosphorylation of the NF proteins in axons can both increase the interﬁlament distance and stabilize cross bridges between neuroﬁlaments.},

Here, we develop a theory by systematically including the electrostatic interactions into the self-consistent field theory for polymers to study the conformational behaviors of a single PE in poor solvents. As the backbone charge fraction of the PE increases, our theory predicts that the spherical globule (Sph) can either be elongated to a series of pearl-necklace (PN) structures or be flattened to two novel structures that have not been reported before: biconcave red cell and toroid. While the PN structures are stable conformations, the two fattened structures are metastable. We find that the cylindrical globule, the stability of which is under debate, is an unstable structure. The signature of the PN structures obtained by our calculation is less pronounced than that reported by other theoretical works due to the continuous change in the curvature from the pearl to the necklace, which, however, is in good agreement with the results from molecular simulations and neutron scattering experiments. In addition, our theory reveals different characteristics of the globule to PN transition: the transition from the Sph to the PN with double pearls is discontinuous, whereas those from adjacent PN structures are continuous at finite salt concentrations. Furthermore, we observe different scaling behaviors: the string width is not a constant as a thermal blob but decays as the backbone charge fraction increases.},

	abstract = {Neuronal injury is a universal event that occurs in disease processes that affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. A blood biomarker linked to neuronal injury would provide a critical measure to understand and treat neurologic diseases. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a cytoskeletal protein expressed only in neurons, has emerged as such a biomarker. With the ability to quantify neuronal damage in blood, NfL is being applied to a wide range of neurologic conditions to investigate and monitor disease including assessment of treatment efficacy. Blood NfL is not specific for one disease and its release can also be induced by physiological processes. Longitudinal studies in multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and stroke show accumulation of NfL over days followed by elevated levels over months. Therefore, it may be hard to determine with a single measurement when the peak of NfL is reached and when the levels are normalized. Nonetheless, measurement of blood NfL provides a new blood biomarker for neurologic diseases overcoming the invasiveness of CSF sampling that restricted NfL clinical application. In this review, we examine the use of blood NfL as a biologic test for neurologic disease.},

	abstract = {The response of stimuli-responsive polymer brushes to moderately elevated pressure is investigated by neutron reﬂectivity and a thermodynamically consistent density functional theory where pressure eﬀects are included by a hydrophobic cavity model. Evidence is provided that temperature and pressure eﬀects on the brush spatial structure are entirely antagonistic. A ∼100 bar/K cancellation eﬀect is found, which we argue is a general feature for hydrophobically associating homopolymers and serves for experimental guidance and ﬁne-control of polymer ﬁlm structure. Our results also suggest that polymeric interfaces which do not show a marked temperature dependence are also rather insensitive to pressure eﬀects for applied pressures below 1 kbar.},

	abstract = {Neutron reﬂectivity, NR, and surface tension, ST, have been used to study the surface adsorption properties at the air−water interface of the anionic surfactant sodium polyethylene glycol monododecyl ether sulfate (sodium lauryl ether sulfate, SLES) in the presence of Al3+ multivalent counterions, by the addition of AlCl3. In the absence of AlCl3 and at low AlCl3 concentrations monolayer adsorption is observed. With increasing AlCl3 concentration, surface multilayer formation is observed, driven by SLES/Al3+ complex formation. The onset of multilayer formation occurs initially as a single bilayer or a multilayer structure with a limited number of bilayers, N, ≤3, and ultimately at higher AlCl3 concentrations N is large, {\textgreater}20. The evolution in the surface structure is determined by the surfactant and AlCl3 concentrations, and the size of the polyethylene oxide group in the diﬀerent SLES surfactants studied. From the NR data, approximate surface phase diagrams are constructed, and the evolution of the surface structure with surfactant and electrolyte concentration is shown to be dependent on the size of the polyethylene oxide group. As the polyethylene oxide group increases in size the multilayer formation requires increasingly higher surfactant and AlCl3 concentrations to promote the formation. This is attributed to the increased steric hindrance of the polyethylene oxide group disrupting SLES/Al3+ complex formation.},

	abstract = {Methods of measuring friction forces in the surface forces apparatus (SFA) are presented for sliding velocities from {\textless}1 nm/s to {\textgreater}10 m/s. A feed-forward control (FFC) system for the piezoelectric bimorph slider attachment is introduced to allow experiments at velocities up to {\textasciitilde}4 mm/s. For still higher speeds, a motor-driven rotating mini-disk setup using a pin-on-disk geometry is presented, with modifications to enable sliding velocities in the ranges 1 cm/s–5 m/s and 1–25 m/s. Example data sets demonstrate the applicability of the approach to modeling important tribological systems including hard-disk drives. We find that mechanical system parameters such as the resonant frequencies and mutual alignments of different moving parts become increasingly important in determining the tribological response at sliding velocities above {\textasciitilde}1 cm/s (for SFA or bench top devices). Smooth or stick-slip sliding—common features of low-speed sliding—become replaced by large-amplitude oscillatory responses that depend on the load and especially the driving speed or rotational/reciprocating frequencies. Detailed recordings and modeling of these complex effects are necessary for fully understanding and controlling frictional behavior at high speeds.},

Three polylactides were synthesized: a deuterated polylactide containing 26\% R-stereocenters (d-PLA-26), a hydrogenous polylactide with an R-content similar to the deuterated polylactide (PLA-28), and a hydrogenous polylactide that contained no R-stereocenters (PLA-0). The hydrogenous polylactides were each solution blended with the d-PLA-26 at a volume fraction of 0.2 for the deuterated polymer, and the melt chain dimensions of these polymers were determined. Small-angle neutron scattering experiments were performed at 30 °C for the d-PLA-26/PLA-28 blend and at 200 °C for both the d-PLA26/PLA-28 and d-PLA-26/PLA-0 blends. Using three analysis methods, the average values for the statistical segment lengths, based on a C6 repeat unit, were found to be 10.0 ( 0.2 Å for the PLA-28 at 30 °C, 8.9 ( 0.2 Å for the PLA-28 at 200 °C, and 9.9 ( 0.4 Å for the PLA-0 at 200 °C.},
