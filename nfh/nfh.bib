Our approach is based on the fabrication of a composite surface where functional kinesin motor-molecules are adsorbed onto a silicon substrate between surface-grafted polymer chains of thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide). By external temperature control between 27 and 35 °C, we demonstrate the reversible landing, gliding, and releasing of motor-driven microtubules in response to conformational changes of the polymer chains. Our method represents a versatile means to control the activity of biomolecular motors, and other surface-coupled enzyme systems, in bionanotechnological applications.},

The {pH}-dependent chemical equilibrium of the monomer units provides a fine-tuning of the ionic transport though the nanopore by simply presetting the {pH} of the electrolyte solution. Our results demonstrate that this strategy enables a higher degree of control over the rectification properties when compared to the nanochannels modified with charged monolayer assemblies.

	abstract = {A major obstacle in the development of highly sensitive electrochemical biosensors is the issue of electrode fouling due to non-specific adsorption of biomolecules on the electrode/sensor surface. The efficacy of such systems is also limited by the need for high densities of immobilized bioactive molecules on the sensor surface. Biomolecules have a natural tendency to randomly adsorb on solid surfaces, which greatly reduces the bioefficiency and biofunctionality of sensing devices. Polymer brushes have recently attracted considerable interest for generating molecularly defined surfaces for applications in nanotechnology, molecular biology, and biomedical sciences. Two main advantages of using polymer brush systems are the ability to mitigate non-specific adsorption and the creation of tailor-made surfaces to control the immobilization of bioanalytes through specific receptor recognition interactions. The use of polymer brushes allows the formation of uniform surfaces with controlled chemical architecture that exhibits good chemical and thermal stability. In this highlight, we use recent examples to demonstrate the role of polymer brushes in the development of sensitive electrochemical biosensors with low detection limits.},

	abstract = {Polypeptoid-coated surfaces and many surface-grafted hydrophilic polymer brushes have been proven efficient in antifouling-the prevention of nonspecific biomolecular adsorption and cell attachment. Protein adsorption, in particular, is known to mediate subsequent cell-surface interactions. However, the detailed antifouling mechanism of polypeptoid and other polymer brush coatings at the molecular level is not well understood. Moreover, most adsorption studies focus only on measuring a single adsorbed mass value, and few techniques are capable of characterizing the hydrated in situ layer structure of either the antifouling coating or adsorbed proteins. In this study, interfacial assembly of polypeptoid brushes with different chain lengths has been investigated in situ using neutron reflection ({NR}). Consistent with past simulation results, {NR} revealed a common two-step structure for grafted polypeptoids consisting of a dense inner region that included a mussel adhesive-inspired oligopeptide for grafting polypeptoid chains and a highly hydrated upper region with very low polymer density (molecular brush). Protein adsorption was studied with human serum albumin ({HSA}) and fibrinogen ({FIB}), two common serum proteins of different sizes but similar isoelectric points ({IEPs}). In contrast to controls, we observed higher resistance by grafted polypeptoid against adsorption of the larger {FIB}, especially for longer chain lengths. Changing the {pH} to close to the {IEPs} of the proteins, which generally promotes adsorption, also did not significantly affect the antifouling effect against {FIB}, which was corroborated by atomic force microscopy imaging. Moreover, {NR} enabled characterization of the in situ hydrated layer structures of the polypeptoids together with proteins adsorbed under selected conditions. While adsorption on bare {SiO}2 controls resulted in surface-induced protein denaturation, this was not observed on polypeptoids. Our current results therefore highlight the detailed in situ view that {NR} may provide for characterizing protein adsorption on polymer brushes as well as the excellent antifouling behavior of polypeptoids.},

Here, we develop a theory by systematically including the electrostatic interactions into the self-consistent field theory for polymers to study the conformational behaviors of a single {PE} in poor solvents. As the backbone charge fraction of the {PE} increases, our theory predicts that the spherical globule (Sph) can either be elongated to a series of pearl-necklace ({PN}) structures or be flattened to two novel structures that have not been reported before: biconcave red cell and toroid. While the {PN} structures are stable conformations, the two fattened structures are metastable. We find that the cylindrical globule, the stability of which is under debate, is an unstable structure. The signature of the {PN} structures obtained by our calculation is less pronounced than that reported by other theoretical works due to the continuous change in the curvature from the pearl to the necklace, which, however, is in good agreement with the results from molecular simulations and neutron scattering experiments. In addition, our theory reveals different characteristics of the globule to {PN} transition: the transition from the Sph to the {PN} with double pearls is discontinuous, whereas those from adjacent {PN} structures are continuous at finite salt concentrations. Furthermore, we observe different scaling behaviors: the string width is not a constant as a thermal blob but decays as the backbone charge fraction increases.},

We collect strong evidence that the electrostatic interactions are a dominant force that controls the {NF} brush structure. There exists a remarkable spatial separation of the H, M, and L tails. In a dephosphorylated {NF} we found conﬁned and ﬂowerlike conformations for the H and M projection domains, respectively. We demonstrate that the ionization of {KSP} repeats in {NF} proteins triggers a conformational transition in the H tail that leads to the expulsion of its terminal ({KEP}) domain to the periphery of the {NF} brush. We argue that the phosphorylation of the {NF} proteins in axons can both increase the interﬁlament distance and stabilize cross bridges between neuroﬁlaments.},

The influence of age and sex is largely unknown, and levels across neurological disorders have not been compared systematically to date.To assess the associations of age, sex, and diagnosis with {NfL} in {CSF} ({cNfL}) and to evaluate its potential in discriminating clinically similar conditions.{PubMed} was searched for studies published between January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2016, reporting {cNfL} levels (using the search terms neurofilament light and cerebrospinal fluid) in neurological or psychiatric conditions and/or in {HC}.Studies reporting {NfL} levels measured in lumbar {CSF} using a commercially available immunoassay, as well as age and sex.Individual-level data were requested from study authors. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the fixed effects of age, sex, and diagnosis on log-transformed {NfL} levels, with cohort of origin modeled as a random intercept.The {cNfL} levels adjusted for age and sex across diagnoses.Data were collected for 10 059 individuals (mean [{SD}] age, 59.7 [18.8] years; 54.1\% female). Thirty-five diagnoses were identified, including inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (n = 2795), dementias and predementia stages (n = 4284), parkinsonian disorders (n = 984), and {HC} (n = 1332). The {cNfL} was elevated compared with {HC} in a majority of neurological conditions studied. Highest levels were observed in cognitively impaired {HIV}-positive individuals ({iHIV}), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia ({FTD}), and Huntington disease. In 33.3\% of diagnoses, including {HC}, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease ({AD}), and Parkinson disease ({PD}), {cNfL} was higher in men than women. The {cNfL} increased with age in {HC} and a majority of neurological conditions, although the association was strongest in {HC}. The {cNfL} overlapped in most clinically similar diagnoses except for {FTD} and {iHIV}, which segregated from other dementias, and {PD}, which segregated from atypical parkinsonian syndromes.These data support the use of {cNfL} as a biomarker of neuroaxonal damage and indicate that age-specific and sex-specific (and in some cases disease-specific) reference values may be needed. The {cNfL} has potential to assist the differentiation of {FTD} from {AD} and {PD} from atypical parkinsonian syndromes.},

A blood biomarker linked to neuronal injury would provide a critical measure to understand and treat neurologic diseases. Neurofilament light chain ({NfL}), a cytoskeletal protein expressed only in neurons, has emerged as such a biomarker. With the ability to quantify neuronal damage in blood, {NfL} is being applied to a wide range of neurologic conditions to investigate and monitor disease including assessment of treatment efficacy. Blood {NfL} is not specific for one disease and its release can also be induced by physiological processes. Longitudinal studies in multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and stroke show accumulation of {NfL} over days followed by elevated levels over months. Therefore, it may be hard to determine with a single measurement when the peak of {NfL} is reached and when the levels are normalized. Nonetheless, measurement of blood {NfL} provides a new blood biomarker for neurologic diseases overcoming the invasiveness of {CSF} sampling that restricted {NfL} clinical application. In this review, we examine the use of blood {NfL} as a biologic test for neurologic disease.},

	abstract = {Neurofilaments ({NFs}) are intermediate filaments with a diameter of 10 nm, similar to that of neurons. Although they are present in perikarya and dendrites, neurofilaments are particularly abundant in axons, where they are essential for the radial growth of axons during development, the maintenance of axon caliber and the transmission of electrical impulses along axons, i.e. velocity of nerve conduction (Eyer and Peterson, 1994; Friede and Samorajski, 1970; Ohara et al., 1993; Yum et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 1997). In some pathological conditions, neurofilaments can accumulate in large numbers within cell bodies and proximal axons of affected neurons (Liu et al., 2009; Munoz et al., 1988). In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}), these accumulations are a hallmark pathological lesion, but they are also prominent in sufferers of other neurological diseases, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth ({CMT}) disease, neurofilament inclusion disease ({NFID}), giant axonal neuropathy ({GAN}), diabetic neuropathy, spinal muscular atrophy ({SMA}) and spastic paraplegia, and are present in those people that suffer from Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) and Parkinson’s disease ({PD}) (Abe et al., 2009; Perrot and Eyer, 2009; Szaro and Strong, 2010). Transgenic mouse models support the idea that these aberrant {NF} accumulations contribute to the death of the affected neurons, rather than simply being by-products of the pathogenic process (Côté et al., 1993; Couillard-Després et al., 1998; Williamson et al., 1998). In this Cell Science at a Glance article, we review the current understanding of neurofilament functions in health and disease.},

Here, we review how {NFs} provide structural support for the highly asymmetric geometries of neurons and, especially, for the marked radial expansion of myelinated axons crucial for effective nerve conduction velocity. {NFs} in axons extensively cross-bridge and interconnect with other non-{IF} components of the cytoskeleton, including microtubules, actin filaments, and other fibrous cytoskeletal elements, to establish a regionally specialized network that undergoes exceptionally slow local turnover and serves as a docking platform to organize other organelles and proteins. We also discuss how a small pool of oligomeric and short filamentous precursors in the slow phase of axonal transport maintains this network. A complex pattern of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events on each subunit modulates filament assembly, turnover, and organization within the axonal cytoskeleton. Multiple factors, and especially turnover rate, determine the size of the network, which can vary substantially along the axon. {NF} gene mutations cause several neuroaxonal disorders characterized by disrupted subunit assembly and {NF} aggregation. Additional {NF} alterations are associated with varied neuropsychiatric disorders. New evidence that subunits of {NFs} exist within postsynaptic terminal boutons and influence neurotransmission suggests how {NF} proteins might contribute to normal synaptic function and neuropsychiatric disease states.},

In this study, we used conformation-sensitive infrared spectroscopy to determine that chain extension in a polymer brush is associated with local conformation rearrangements, i.e., contraction of side groups and increased proportion of gauche twists in the backbone, which served to increase molecular disorder at or below the segmental scale. This conformational transition points to a particular molecular mechanism for chain extension in densely tethered polymers, wherein increased local disorder facilitates global chain ordering (i.e., chain extension) and therefore supplements our current understanding of chain orientation at a molecular level.},

	abstract = {We consider planar brushes formed by end-grafted polymers with moderate to strong excluded-volume interactions. We first rederive the mean-field theory and solve the resulting self-consistent equations numerically. In the continuum limit, the results depend sensitively on a single parameter, β, whose square is the ratio of the scaling prediction for the brush height to the unperturbed polymer radius of gyration, and which measures therefore the degree to which the polymers are stretched. For large values of β, the density profile is close to parabolic, as predicted by the infinite-stretching theory of Zhulina et al. and of Milner et al. As β decreases, the profile deviates strongly from a parabolic one. By calculating the most probable paths and comparing their contribution to various properties with those obtained from the full self-consistent theory, we determine the effect of the fluctuations about such paths. At large values of β, these effects are very small everywhere. As β decreases, fluctuation effects on the density profile become increasingly important near the grafting surface, but remain small far from it. For all values of β, we find that polymer paths which begin far from the grafting surface are strongly, and almost uniformly, stretched throughout their length, including their free end points. Paths which begin close to the grafting surface are also stretched, but they initially move away from the grafting surface before reaching a maximum height and then returning to it. The classical theory is then derived from the self-consistent field equations by retaining, for each end point location, only that single trajectory which minimizes the free energy of the system. This free energy contains an entropy, of relative weight β-1, which arises from the distribution of end points. Even for brushes which are only moderately stretched, the results of the classical theory for the brush profile and polymer end point distribution agree well with those of the full self-consistent theory except near the grafting surface itself. There the density profile as calculated in the self-consistent theory shows a characteristic decrease which is not captured by the classical theory. However it does capture the fact that the individual polymer paths are stretched in general throughout their length, including the end points, and yields nonmonotonic paths for polymers whose end points are close to the grafting surface. In addition, it reproduces extremely well the form of the density distribution far from the grafting surface, which is essentially Gaussian. This results from the fact that the stretching energy dominates the interaction energy of those polymers which extend far from the grafting surface, so that their behavior is nearly ideal. In the limit of infinite stretching, β → ∞, the theory reduces to that of Zhulina et al. and of Milner et al.},

Stratification in binary brushes is predicted: the shorter chains are entirely embedded in the proximal sublayer depleted of end-points of longer chains while the peripheral sublayer contains exclusively terminal segments of longer chains. The boundary between sublayers is enriched with counterions that neutralize the residual charge of the proximal sublayer.

Near physiological conditions (86mM monovalent salt and {pH} 6.8), {NF}-{LM} networks with a high {NF}-M grafting density favor nematic ordering whereas filaments composed of {NF}-{LH} transition to an isotropic gel at low protein concentrations as a function of increasing mole fraction of {NF}-H subunits. The interfilament distance decreases with {NF}-M grafting density, opposite the trend seen with {NF}-{LH} networks. This suggests a competition between the more attractive {NF}-M sidearms, forming a compact aligned nematic gel, and the repulsive {NF}-H sidearms, favoring a more expansive isotropic gel, at 86mM monovalent salt. These interactions are highly salt dependent and the nematic gel phase is stabilized with increasing monovalent salt.},

The fraction of the admixed macromolecules is taken to be small. Shorter minority chains form slightly deformed random coils with both the average end height and its fluctuation proportional to K1/2. A longer minority chain with K {\textgreater} N acquires an inhomogeneous flower-like conformation: an N-segment stem of height H equal to the thickness of the brush and a randomly coiled crown outside the brush. The stem is strongly stretched and fluctuates only weakly. The transition from one type of conformation to another occurs as the number of segments of the minority chain, K, changes within a narrow range around N, where the chain is simultaneously strongly stretched and strongly fluctuating. We show that the coilto-flower transition has some features of both the first- and the second-order phase transitions.},

The work is a continuation of a similar study of a neutral polymer brush in a solvent mixture with a pronounced solubility gap. We study both the structure and structural transitions of the brush in particular in the one-phase region of the solvent mixture in the bulk. With respect to the neutral system, the polyelectrolyte system is even richer in its behavior. Starting from a nonpolar main solvent, upon increasing the chemical potential of water, we find the development of a mesoscopic water film inside the brush. The polymer takes up this thin film as it finds an environment that allows for the dissociation of its groups energetically attractive. The phase transition can be accompanied by an anomalous collapse of the ionizable brush and tuned by the {pH} of the solution and the ionic strength in the system. Another brush transition can occur when nonpolar solvent is added to a brush immersed in water. Finally, it is feasible that systems exist that feature three successive brush transitions upon changing the bulk composition from pre-binodal, to biphasic, and then to post-binodal compositions, where a forward, a reentry, and again a forward transition are found, respectively.},

We extend previous work on polyelectrolyte brushes and find evidence for a structural phase transition caused by internal phase separation in the polyelectrolyte brush upon a decrease of the solvent quality. In the limit of long chains, when a local electroneutrality approximation is exact, we find that the transition in the brush is continuous and tends to be second order. In the numerical calculations which employ the full Poisson-Boltzmann equation, a parameter window is found in which the structural phase transition is first-order. This is proven by the existence of a hysteresis loop in various properties of the brush, such as the degree of dissociation, the average height, the electrostatic potential profile, and the overall and end segmentdensity profiles. Apart from this difference as to the order of the transition, we find extremely good correspondence between the numerical calculations and the analytical asymptotic analysis for long polymer chains. The structure of the internally phase-separated layer is characterized by a condensed phase near the surface, a dilute swollen layer extending far into solution, and a thin interface between the two regions.},

The theory clarifies the nature of the first-order transition initiating the ordering and predicts the effect of the chain length, N, on the transition point and on the size of the critical nucleus of the ordered phase. For bidisperse brushes composed of chains of two fractions differing in contour length, the theory explains two mechanisms of ordering observed by self-consistentfield computer modeling and gives predictions for certain important features of the ordering (character of transitions, shifts of the transition points, and parameter domains of ordering mechanisms). Predictions of the analytical theory are in good agreement with the results of {SCF} computer modeling.},

We show that ion specificity within the brush can bring about large changes in conformation. It is found that the collapse transition of hydrophobic, weak polyelectrolyte brushes features an intermediate two-phase state wherein a subset of chains are collapsed in a dense layer at the substrate, while the remainder of chains are well-solvated and strongly stretched away from the it. Besides {pH} and ionic strength, solvent quality of counterions and the composition of ions in the solvent are important control parameters for the behavior of polyelectrolyte brushes. Increasingly hydrophobic counterions penetrate deeper within the brush and stabilize the collapsed region, while hydrophilic counterions do the opposite.},

The intra-brush nanoscale segregation is governed by a balance of intermolecular interactions with conformational entropy of the brush-forming chains and may be triggered by external stimuli that affect the strength of the inter-chain interactions. Both vertical and lateral segregation in the brushes have important implication for applications of brushes for modification of physico-chemical and (bio)interactive properties of interfaces, as well as in biological functions of biopolymer brushes widely found in living nature. While the effects of microphase segregation in polymer brushes are well understood on the basis of existing theories, experimental observation and characterization of such structures using surface-sensitive techniques often remains challenging. Here we present an overview of the state-of-the-art in experimental work on high-resolution structural characterization of polymer brushes in relation to the existing theoretical predictions.

As a result, polymer brushes can be used in lubrication or as biological coatings against toxic molecules. Here, we study the interaction of nanoparticles with a brush using selfconsistent ﬁeld theory ({SCFT}). For a large particle compressing a brush, we reproduce the linear scaling of the repulsive potential with the particle radius found previously using {SCFT}. Also, we ﬁnd that this linearity gives way to a nonlinear (parabolic or cubic) dependence on the particle size for particles inserted deeply into the brush, consistent with earlier particle-based simulations. The insertion of particles disrupts the brush, changing polymer−particle interactions for subsequent nanoparticles, thus introducing eﬀective particle−particle interactions mediated by the brush. When the grafting point is mobile in the plane of the grafting surface, our results suggest that the brush promotes clustering of inclusions. In contrast, inclusions tend to be dispersed when the grafting point is ﬁxed. Finally, we discuss the biological implications of these ﬁndings: interactions of antimicrobial peptides with bacterial lipopolysaccharides and clustering of integrin on cancerous cell membranes.},

By increasing brush density, a stretched brush conformation is formed as a result of constraining the cross-sectional area of that brush strand which thereby inﬂuences the interactions of molecules with the brush surface. The associated residual stress also gives polymer brushes properties distinct from an equivalent layer of coated polymer chains. Examples of uncharged and charged “grown from” polymer brushes, the eﬀect of architecture on physical behavior, and the inﬂuence of nanoscale patterning will be described.

A combination of experimental analysis of polystyrene ({PS})/ poly(methyl methacrylate) ({PMMA}) brushes and selfconsistent field theory ({SCFT}) simulations is employed to determine the phases of annealed binary brushes. By annealing the brushes under conditions that maximize lateral versus vertical separation, a rich array of phases are observed with general agreement to predictions by {SCFT} simulations. The incorporation of random perturbations to the grafting density in {SCFT} simulations accounts for disorder in the arrangement of the polymer domains for the {PS}/{PMMA} brushes. Additionally, autocorrelation of the polymer domains yields an experimental domain spacing that is nearly 2 times greater than {SCFT} predictions, which is hypothesized to result from polydispersity in the {PS}/{PMMA} brushes. These findings should provide a basis for the improved fabrication of nanopatterned mixed polymer brushes with implications for the enhancement of biological surfaces, membranes, and nanolithography.},

	abstract = {The overall charge content and the patterning of charged residues have a profound impact on the conformational ensembles adopted by intrinsically disordered proteins. These parameters can be altered by charge regulation, which refers to the eﬀects of post-translational modiﬁcations, {pH}-dependent changes to charge, and conformational ﬂuctuations that modify the {pKa} values of ionizable residues. Although atomistic simulations have played a prominent role in uncovering the major sequence-ensemble relationships of {IDPs}, most simulations assume ﬁxed charge states for ionizable residues. This may lead to erroneous estimates for conformational equilibria if they are linked to charge regulation. Here, we report the development of a new method we term q-canonical Monte Carlo sampling for modeling the linkage between charge regulation and conformational equilibria. The method, which is designed to be interoperable with the {ABSINTH} implicit solvation model, operates as follows: For a protein sequence with n ionizable residues, we start with all 2n charge microstates and use a criterion based on model compound {pKa} values to prune down to a subset of thermodynamically relevant charge microstates. This subset is then grouped into mesostates, where all microstates that belong to a mesostate have the same net charge. Conformational distributions, drawn from a canonical ensemble, are generated for each of the charge microstates that make up a mesostate using a method we designate as proton walk sampling. This method combines Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling in conformational space with an auxiliary Markov process that enables interconversions between charge microstates along a mesostate. Proton walk sampling helps identify the most likely charge microstate per mesostate. We then use thermodynamic integration aided by the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio method to estimate the free energies for converting between mesostates. These free energies are then combined with the per-microstate weights along each mesostate to estimate standard state free energies and {pH}-dependent free energies for all thermodynamically relevant charge microstates. The results provide quantitative estimates of the probabilities and preferred conformations associated with every thermodynamically accessible charge microstate. We showcase the application of q-canonical sampling using two model systems. The results establish the soundness of the method and the importance of charge regulation in systems characterized by conformational heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins ({IDPs}) play central roles in numerous cellular processes. While {IDP} structure and function are often regulated by multisite phosphorylation, the biophysical mechanisms linking these post-translational modiﬁcations to {IDP} structure remain elusive. For example, the intrinsically disordered C-terminal sidearm domain of the neuroﬁlament heavy subunit ({NFH}-{SA}) forms a dense brush along axonal {NF} backbones and is subject to extensive serine phosphorylation. Yet, biophysical insight into the relationship between phosphorylation and structure has been limited by the lack of paradigms in which {NF} brush conformational responses can be measured in the setting of controlled phosphorylation. Here, we approach this question by immobilizing a recombinant {NFH}-{SA} ({rNFH}-{SA}) as {IDP} brushes onto glass, and controllably phosphorylating the sequence in situ with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ({ERK}2) preactivated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ({MKK}). We then monitor brush height changes using atomic force microscopy, which shows that phosphorylation induces signiﬁcant brush swelling to an extent that strongly depends upon {pH} and ionic strength, consistent with a mechanism in which phosphorylation regulates brush structure through local electrostatic interactions. Further consistent with this mechanism, the phosphorylated {rNFH}-{SA} brush may be dramatically condensed with micromolar concentrations of divalent cations. Phosphorylation-induced height changes are qualitatively reversible via alkaline phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation. Our study demonstrates that multisite phosphorylation controls {NFH}-{SA} structure through modulation of chain electrostatics and points to a general strategy for engineering {IDP}-based interfaces that can be reversibly and dynamically modulated by enzymes.},

The modified force field features stronger amide–water electrostatic interactions than the original {OPLS} model, predicts a weaker water-mediated monomer–monomer attraction, and reproduces the experimental coil–globule collapse enthalpy of {PNIPAM} in water. We revisit the cononsolvency problem of {PNIPAM} in methanol/water mixtures with the modified model and show that the dependence of the coil–globule collapse enthalpy on methanol concentration follows the experimental trend of the lower critical solution temperature.

Polyelectrolyte brushes are important in a variety of applications, including stabilizing colloidal particles and lubricating surfaces. Many uses rely on the extension of the densely grafted polymer chains from the surface in the extended brush morphology. In the presence of multivalent ions, brushes are significantly shorter than in monovalent ionic solutions, which greatly affects their properties. We base our theoretical analysis on an analogous collapse of polyelectrolyte brushes in a poor solvent, providing an energy balance representation for pinned micelles and cylindrical bundles. The equilibrium brush heights predicted for these structures are of a similar magnitude to those measured experimentally. The formation of lateral structures can open new avenues for stimuli-responsive applications that rely on nanoscale pattern formation on surfaces.},

It is found that below a critical electric field, local electroneutrality holds for densely grafted brushes and the brush height remains independent of field intensity. Above this critical field (which scales as 1/3 with grafting density) brush height increases smoothly, and the fraction of condensed counterions decreases. The brush bifurcates into two subpopulations of stretched and collapsed chains when the grafting density is not low. At intermediate grafting densities, the majority of chains are stretched and the minority are nonstretched. At high grafting densities bifurcation and brush height growth occur consecutively. The majority of the chains are nonstretched at high grafting densities. Although not observed prior to overstretching of the chain model, it is predicted that the two subpopulations will re-merge to a single highly stretched phase when field intensity reaches a third critical value. The ability to control subpopulations of chains suggests that utilizing electric fields normal to polyelectrolyte brushes holds potential as controllable gates in microfluidic devices.},

	abstract = {Recent fully atomistic molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulation of polymer nanocomposites based on polylactic acid ({PLA}) filled with cellulose nanocrystals ({CNC}) covalently modified by grafting of lactic acid oligomers ({OLA}) [A.D. Glova et al. Soft Matter 13 (2017) 6627] have revealed a non-trivial structure of the {OLA} brush. It was found that a segregation of grafted {OLA} chains into two groups, or populations, occurs due to the presence of partial charges so that a fraction of chains folds back to the surface and acquires a hairpin-like conformation. Motivated by these results, we study the structure of a brush made of polymers with dipole moments oriented along the main chain (dipolar chains of A type) by using the numerical self-consistent field method for lattice models. In full agreement with the results of {MD} simulation study, the segregation of brush chains in two populations is observed as the strength of dipole-dipole interactions increases: A part of the brush chains folds back to form hairpin-like conformation while the remaining chains are extended and directed towards the brush periphery. An increase of the strength of dipole-dipole interactions and/or grafting density leads to the increase in the fraction of backfolded chains. We develop an analytical mean-field theory for the brush in the “dry” state which demonstrates the thermodynamic advantage of backfolding for a fraction of the brush chains. We find that the key factor leading to the observed non-trivial brush structure is the grafting of the chains in the brush via the same end. In contrast, in the case of the brush with the equal amount of chains grafted via each of the two ends, the dipole-dipole interactions do not result in the backfolding. This prediction for the lattice model is confirmed by additional fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the corresponding {OLA} brush grafted onto {CNC} surface and immersed in the {PLA} melt.},

Nonetheless, the ability to design soft matter systems that recreate the complexity of life remains limited. Here, we survey the use of responsive surface-grafted polymer brushes to mimic biological function. We summarize various ways in which surface-grafted brushes respond to stimuli. Next, we highlight examples of biomimetic engineering that mimic specific biological structures, including molecular motors, ion channels, leukocytes, and leaves. Finally, we discuss recent studies that design brushes to generate lifelike behavior and interrogate their response under the non-equilibrium, spatiotemporally heterogeneous conditions in living systems. Specifically, we focus on hysteresis in the brush response, as one example of nonlinear response; slow diffusion, used by biological systems to maintain chemical gradients; self-oscillation, as an example of auto-amplification of stimuli; and patterned responsiveness, as an example of compartmentalization. This focus emphasizes the emerging need to rationally design the response of brushes for use as soft components in dynamic, life-inspired systems.},

We synthesized high-density polystyrenesulfonate ({PSS}) brushes using surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization and performed neutron reflectivity ({NR}) and surface force measurements using a surface forces apparatus ({SFA}) to investigate the effect of monovalent Na+, divalent Ca2+, Mg2+, and Ba2+, and trivalent Y3+ counterions on the structure of the {PSS} brushes. {NR} and {SFA} results demonstrate that in monovalent salt solution the behavior of the {PSS} brushes agrees with scaling theory well, exhibiting two distinct regimes: the osmotic and salted brush regimes. Introducing trivalent Y3+ cations causes an abrupt shrinkage of the {PSS} brush due to the uptake of Y3+ counterions. The uptake of Y3+ counterions and shrinkage of the brush are reversible upon increasing the concentration of monovalent salt. Divalent cations, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+, while all significantly affecting the structure of {PSS} brushes, show strong ion specific effects that are related to the specific interactions between the divalent cations and the sulfonate groups. Our results demonstrate that the presence of multivalent counterions, even at relatively low concentrations, can strongly affect the structure of polyelectrolyte brushes. The results also highlight the importance of ion specificity to the structure of polyelectrolyte brushes in solution.},

	abstract = {We propose an analytic approach for calculating the electrostatic energy of proteins or protein complexes in aqueous solution. This method, termed {CVCEL} (Circular Variance Continuum {ELectrostatics}), is fitted to Poisson calculations and is able to reproduce the corresponding energies for different choices of solute dielectric constant. {CVCEL} thus treats both solute charge interactions and charge self-energies, and it can also deal with salt solutions. Electrostatic damping notably depends on the degree of solvent exposure of the charges, quantified here in terms of circular variance, a measure that reflects the vectorial distribution of the neighbors around a given center. {CVCEL} energies can be calculated rapidly and have simple analytical derivatives. This approach avoids the need for calculating effective atomic volumes or Born radii. After describing how the method was developed, we present test results for coarse-grain proteins of different shapes and sizes, using different internal dielectric constants and different salt concentrations and also compare the results with those from simple distance-dependent models. We also show that the {CVCEL} approach can be used successfully to calculate the changes in electrostatic energy associated with changes in protein conformation or with protein-protein binding.},

In the absence of {AlCl}3 and at low {AlCl}3 concentrations monolayer adsorption is observed. With increasing {AlCl}3 concentration, surface multilayer formation is observed, driven by {SLES}/Al3+ complex formation. The onset of multilayer formation occurs initially as a single bilayer or a multilayer structure with a limited number of bilayers, N, ≤3, and ultimately at higher {AlCl}3 concentrations N is large, {\textgreater}20. The evolution in the surface structure is determined by the surfactant and {AlCl}3 concentrations, and the size of the polyethylene oxide group in the different {SLES} surfactants studied. From the {NR} data, approximate surface phase diagrams are constructed, and the evolution of the surface structure with surfactant and electrolyte concentration is shown to be dependent on the size of the polyethylene oxide group. As the polyethylene oxide group increases in size the multilayer formation requires increasingly higher surfactant and {AlCl}3 concentrations to promote the formation. This is attributed to the increased steric hindrance of the polyethylene oxide group disrupting {SLES}/Al3+ complex formation.},

This mini-review will coherently present the broad range of antifouling strategies, germicidal, preventive and cleaning using one or more of biological, chemical and physical techniques. These techniques will be discussed from the point of view of their ability to inhibit protein adsorption, usually the first step that eventually leads to fouling. Many of these approaches draw their inspiration from nature, such as emulating the nitric oxide production in endothelium, use of peptoids that mimic protein repellant peptides, zwitterionic functionalities found in membrane structures, and catechol functionalities used by mussel to immobilize poly(ethylene glycol) ({PEG}). More intriguing are the physical modifications, creation of micropatterns on the surface to control the hydration layer, making them either superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic. This has led to technologies that emulate the texture of shark skin, and the superhyprophobicity of self-cleaning textures found in lotus leaves. The mechanism of antifouling in each of these methods is described, and implementation of these ideas is illustrated with examples in a way that could be adapted to prevent infection in medical devices.},

	abstract = {We provide an in-depth study of pseudo-spectral numerical methods associated with modeling the self-assembly of molten mixed polymer brushes in the framework of self-consistent field theory ({SCFT}). {SCFT} of molten polymer brushes has proved numerically challenging in the past because of sharp features that arise in the self-consistent pressure field at the grafting surface due to the chain end tethering constraint. We show that this pressure anomaly can be reduced by smearing the grafting points over a narrow zone normal to the surface in an incompressible model, and/or by switching to a compressible model for the molten brush. In both cases, we use results obtained from a source (delta function) distribution of grafting points as a reference. At the grafting surface, we consider both Neumann and Dirichlet conditions, where the latter is paired with a masking method to mimic a confining surface. When only the density profiles and relative free energies of two comparison phases are of interest, either source or smeared distributions of grafting points can be used, but a smeared distribution of grafting points exhibits faster convergence with respect to the number of chain contour steps. Absolute free energies converge only within the smeared model. In addition, when a sine basis is used with the masking method and a smeared distribution, fewer iterations are necessary to converge the {SCFT} fields for the compressible model. The numerical methods described here and investigated in one-dimension will provide an enabling platform for computationally more demanding three-dimensional {SCFT} studies of a broad range of mixed polymer brush systems.},

Folding is assumed to be driven by the association of solvophobic monomers to avoid solvent and opposed by the chain configurational entropy. Theory predicts a phase transition as a function of temperature or solvent character. Molecules that are too short or too long or that have too few solvophobic residues are predicted not to fold. Globular molecules should have a largely solvophobic core, but there is an entropic tendency for some residues to be “out of place”, particularly in small molecules. For long chains, molecules comprised of globular domains are predicted to be thermodynamically more stable than spherical molecules. The number of accessible conformations in the globular state is calculated to be an exceedingly small fraction of the number available to the random coil. Previous estimates of this number, which have motivated kinetic theories of folding, err by many tens of orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {A tetrahedral polyelectrolyte brush in the presence of trivalent counterions is researched under the condition of good solution by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Grafting density and charge fraction are varied to generate a series of surface patterns. Lateral microphase separation happens and various interesting pinned patches appear at appropriate charge fraction and grafting density. Through a careful analysis on the brush thickness, the pair correlation functions, the distributions of net charge, and the four states of trivalent counterions in the brush, we find that the ordered surface patterns and special properties are induced by the pure electrostatic correlation effect of trivalent ions even in the good solvent. Furthermore, the dependences of electrostatic correlation on the charge fraction of tethered chains are evaluated for fixed grafting density. Also, our results can serve as a guide for precise control over the stimuli-responsive materials rational and self-assembly of nanoparticles.},

The diagram contains fields of disordered distribution of monomer units and of prolonged aggregates, regions of lamellae with small and big domain spacing, and transition region. Within the transition region, the lamellae with different spacing coexist: the lamellae with big domain spacing are on the top of the grafting layer and the lamellae with small domain spacing are close to the grafting surface. The lamellae are connected with each other and form bicontinuous parking garage structure joining all side groups into a single cluster. The domain spacing of lamellae does not depend on the macromolecular length, but the width of the transition region decreases with the decrease of polymerization degree until total vanishing at relatively short macromolecules. The sharp switch between lamellae and bicontinuous structure opens the perspective for practical applications of densely grafted layers with amphiphilic monomer units.},

	abstract = {We investigated, by experiment and theory, the lateral structure of a weak polyelectrolyte brush at various added salt concentrations and chain grafting densities. Model poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) ({PDMAEMA}) brushes with grafting density gradients were developed for this study by using a novel “Langmuir-Blodgett-deposition-under-compression” ({LB}{\textbackslash}C) method. Fluid {AFM} images of these brushes indicate that the lateral structure of the brush system is sensitive to both added salt concentration and grafting density. Under low salt conditions, 0−20 {mM} {NaCl}, the brush structure shows strong microscopic lateral heterogeneities at high grafting densities; both the width and height of the heterogeneities increase with increasing grafting density but are independent of the salt concentration. As the bulk salt concentration is increased to an intermediate regime, 60−100 {mM} {NaCl}, these heterogeneities become smaller in size and number, coexisting with smooth homogeneous regions. At high enough concentrations, 300−500 {mM} {NaCl}, the entire surface becomes homogeneous. A simple free energy-based Flory-type argument is presented which explains the essential features of the thermodynamic behavior of the brush system. In the zero-salt limit, relatively few monomers are charged, and the hydrophobicity of the backbone chain drives the collapse/aggregation of the chains. At high salt concentrations, the brush chains become sufficiently charged to overcome the hydrophobic nature of the monomers and stabilize the homogeneous state. However, at intermediate salt concentrations, it is found that the osmotic pressure of the counterions surrounding the charged polymer moieties can be decreased by collapsing the chain structure while simultaneously decreasing the number of charges along the backbone and releasing small ions into the bulk solution. This effect, which we term “osmotic instability”, serves to destabilize the homogeneous brush configuration.},

	abstract = {Coarse-grained molecular dynamics enhanced by free-energy sampling methods is used to examine the roles of solvophobicity and multivalent salts on polyelectrolyte brush collapse. Specifically, we demonstrate that while ostensibly similar, solvophobic collapsed brushes and multivalent-ion collapsed brushes exhibit distinct mechanistic and structural features. Notably, multivalent-induced heterogeneous brush collapse is observed under good solvent polymer backbone conditions, demonstrating that the mechanism of multivalent collapse is not contingent upon a solvophobic backbone. Umbrella sampling of the potential of mean-force ({PMF}) between two individual brush strands confirms this analysis, revealing starkly different {PMFs} under solvophobic and multivalent conditions, suggesting the role of multivalent “bridging” as the discriminating feature in trivalent collapse. Structurally, multivalent ions show a propensity for nucleating order within collapsed brushes, whereas poor-solvent collapsed brushes are more disordered; this difference is traced to the existence of a metastable {PMF} minimum for poor solvent conditions, and a global {PMF} minimum for trivalent systems, under experimentally relevant conditions.},

Polyelectrolyte brush forms: (1) vertically oriented cylindrical aggregates (bundles of chains), (2) maze-like aggregate structures, or (3) thin polymeric layer covering a substrate. These different brush morphologies appear as a result of the fine interplay between electrostatic and short-range monomer−monomer interactions. The brush thickness shows nonmonotonic dependence on the value of the Bjerrum length. It first increases with the increasing value of the Bjerrum length, and then it begins to decrease. This behavior is a result of counterion condensation within a brush volume.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns an acceleration method for fixed-point iterations that originated in work of D. G. Anderson [J. Assoc. Comput. Mach., 12 (1965), pp. 547–560], which we accordingly call Anderson acceleration here. This method has enjoyed considerable success and wide usage in electronic structure computations, where it is known as Anderson mixing; however, it seems to have been untried or underexploited in many other important applications. Moreover, while other acceleration methods have been extensively studied by the mathematics and numerical analysis communities, this method has received relatively little attention from these communities over the years. A recent paper by H. Fang and Y. Saad [Numer. Linear Algebra Appl., 16 (2009), pp. 197–221] has clarified a remarkable relationship of Anderson acceleration to quasi-Newton (secant updating) methods and extended it to define a broader Anderson family of acceleration methods. In this paper, our goals are to shed additional light on Anderson acceleration and to draw further attention to its usefulness as a general tool. We first show that, on linear problems, Anderson acceleration without truncation is “essentially equivalent” in a certain sense to the generalized minimal residual ({GMRES}) method. We also show that the Type 1 variant in the Fang–Saad Anderson family is similarly essentially equivalent to the Arnoldi (full orthogonalization) method. We then discuss practical considerations for implementing Anderson acceleration and illustrate its performance through numerical experiments involving a variety of applications.},

Attempts at rationalizing the general principles underlying both conformational properties and transitions of {IDPs}/{IDRs} must consider the abundance of charged residues (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg) that typifies these proteins, rendering them assimilable to polyampholytes or polyelectrolytes. Their conformation strongly depends on both the charge density and distribution along the sequence (i.e., charge decoration) as highlighted by recent experimental and theoretical studies that have introduced novel descriptors. Published experimental data are revisited herein in the frame of this formalism, in a new and possibly unitary perspective. The physicochemical properties most directly affected by charge density and distribution are compaction and solubility, which can be described in a relatively simplified way by tools of polymer physics. Dissecting factors controlling such properties could contribute to better understanding complex biological phenomena, such as fibrillation and phase separation. Furthermore, this knowledge is expected to have enormous practical implications for the design, synthesis, and exploitation of bio-derived materials and the control of natural biological processes.},

	abstract = {Conventional models of weak polyelectrolytes are formulated in terms of either an average degree of ionization or a rigid polymer conformation. While the decoupling of segment-level ionization and polymer structure simplifies the theoretical procedure and is beneficial from a computational perspective, it misses intrachain correlations (i.e., interactions beyond adjacent monomers) that are important for systems at a low polymer concentration with strong electrostatic interactions. In this work, we propose a hierarchical method that incorporates the liquid-state theories with the site-binding model to account for the effects of the local ionic environment on both inter- and intrachain correlations. A wormlike-chain model is introduced to describe the coupling of polymer conformation and monomeric ionization with the long-range electrostatic interactions accounted for by using the Gibbs–Bogoliubov variational principle. Through an extensive comparison of the theoretical predictions with experimental titration curves for poly(acrylic acid) in different alkali chloride solutions, we demonstrate that the hierarchical model is able to quantify the charging behavior of weak polyelectrolytes over a broad range of solution conditions.},

The model simplifies the interactions between the {NF} core and the sidearm or between the sidearms by the sum of excluded volume, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions, where both monovalent salt ions and solvents are implicitly incorporated into the electrostatic interaction potential. Several important observations are made from the {MC} simulations of the coarse-grained model {NF} systems. First, the mean-field type description of monovalent salt ions works reasonably well in the {NF} system. Second, the manner by which the {NF} sidearms are arranged on the surface of the {NF} backbone core has little influence on the lateral extension of {NF} sidearms. Third, the lateral extension of the {NF} sidearms is highly affected by the ionic strength of the system: at low ionic strength, {NF}-M is most extended but at high ionic strength, {NF}-H is more stretched out because of the effective screening of the electrostatic interaction. Fourth, the presence of Ca2 + ions induces the attraction between negatively charged residues, which leads to the contraction of the overall {NF} extension. Finally, the introduction of hydrophobic interaction does not change the general structural organization of the {NF} sidearms except that the overall extension is contracted.},

Here, we probe the effect of phosphorylation on the structure of the C-terminal domain of the human neurofilament heavy chain {NFH} using molecular dynamics simulations. Our study indicates that the unphosphorylated {NFH} side arm is unstructured and characterized by several flexible loops stabilized by salt bridges. Phosphorylation of multiple {SER} residues is shown to destabilize these bridges due to electrostatic repulsion and thereby increase side arm size. We demonstrate that phosphorylation acts locally by modulating intramolecular electrostatic interactions to cause global changes in the otherwise disordered side arm.

	abstract = {The interpenetration of two polymer brushes on approaching flat surfaces has been investigated. When compacting polymer brushes with an asymmetric charge on each surface, one neutral and the other weakly charged, we find that the brush interpenetration becomes a parameter that can be controlled by the {pH} of the hydrating solution. The switching between high and low degrees of brush interpenetration was investigated with numerical self-consistent field theory ({nSCF}) and experimentally using a sample environment which combines neutron reflectometry with a surface force type apparatus. Initially, a pair of uncharged poly(ethylene oxide), {PEO}, brushes are examined, where one of the brushes is deuterated to distinguish it from a hydrogenous counterpart. We find in both {nSCF} and these experiments that there is no significant overlap between the brushes as both compact into polymer blocks with little hydration. However, when a weak polyelectrolyte poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate), {PDMAEMA}, brush is confined against a deuterated neutral {PEO} brush and the {pH} of the hydrating solution is below the polycation’s {pKa} of 7.5, then the presence of charged groups on the {PDMAEMA} allows significant interpenetration to occur between the two polymer brushes on contact. This interpenetration remains once the polymer brushes dehydrate due to the confining pressure that is applied. Raising the {pH} to a value above the {pKa}, removes the charges from the polyelectrolyte brush resulting in little to no interpenetration between the two brushes. Therefore, by simply adjusting the {pH} of the hydrating solution the interpenetration state between polymer brush pairs can be switched when one brush is a weak polyelectrolyte. Since polymer brushes are widely investigated and used to reduce friction between solid surfaces, this effect may have significant implications in the design and operation of polymer brushes with controllable friction properties.},
