	abstract = {We elucidate the sequence of events occurring during the collapse transition of thermoresponsive copolymer brushes based on poly(di(ethyleneglycol) methyl ether methacrylate) chains (PMEO2MA) grown by atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The collapse of the bulk of the brush is followed by quartz crystal microbalance measurements with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), and the collapse of its outer surface is assessed by measuring equilibrium water contact angles in the captive bubble configuration. The bulk of the brush collapses over a broad temperature interval (∼25 °C), and the end of this process is signaled by a sharp first-order transition of the surface of the brush. These observations support theoretical predictions regarding the occurrence of a vertical phase separation during collapse, with surface properties of thermoresponsive brushes exhibiting a sharp variation at a temperature of Tbrsurf. In contrast, the bulk properties of the brush vary smoothly, with a bulk transition Tbrbulk occurring on average ∼8 °C below Tbrsurf and ∼5 °C below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of free chains in solution. These observations should also be valid for planar brushes of other neutral, water-soluble thermoresponsive polymers such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). We also propose a way to analyze more quantitatively the temperature dependence of the QCM-D response of thermoresponsive brushes and deliver a simple thermodynamic interpretation of equilibrium contact angles, which can be of use for other complex temperature-responsive solvophilic systems.},

We study the structure and electroresponsiveness of weak polyacid brushes using an inhomogeneous theory that incorporates both electrostatic and chain connectivity correlations at the Debye–Hückel level. Our calculation shows that a weak polyacid brush swells under the application of a negative applied potential, in agreement with recent experimental observation. We rationalize this behavior using a scaling argument that accounts for the effect of the surface charge. We also show that the swelling behavior has a direct influence on the differential capacitance, which can be modulated by the solvent quality, pH, and salt concentration.},

Previous studies have suggested that NF number as well as the phosphorylation state of the COOH-terminal tail of the heavy neurofilament (NF-H) subunit are major determinants of axonal caliber. We created NF-H knockout mice to assess the contribution of NF-H to the development of axon size as well as its effect on the amounts of low and mid-sized NF subunits (NF-L and NF-M respectively). Surprisingly, we found that NF-L levels were reduced only slightly whereas NF-M and tubulin proteins were unchanged in NF-H–null mice. However, the calibers of both large and small diameter myelinated axons were diminished in NF-H–null mice despite the fact that these mice showed only a slight decrease in NF density and that filaments in the mutant were most frequently spaced at the same interfilament distance found in control. Significantly, large diameter axons failed to develop in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. These results demonstrate directly that unlike losing the NF-L or NF-M subunits, loss of NF-H has only a slight effect on NF number in axons. Yet NF-H plays a major role in the development of large diameter axons.},

Surprisingly, the lack of NF-H subunits had little effect on axonal calibers and electron microscopy revealed no significant changes in the number and packing density of neurofilaments made up of only the neurofilament light (NF-L) and neurofilament medium (NF-M) subunits. However, our analysis of NF-H knockout mice revealed an ∼2.4-fold increase of microtubule density in their large ventral root axons. This finding was further corroborated by a corresponding increase in the ratio of assembled tubulin to NF-L protein in insoluble cytoskeletal preparations from the sciatic nerve. Axonal transport studies carried out by the injection of [35S]methionine into spinal cord revealed an increased transport velocity of newly synthesized NF-L and NF-M proteins in motor axons of NF-H knockout mice. When treated with β,β′-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN), a neurotoxin that segregates microtubules and retards neurofilament transport, mice heterozygous or homozygous for the NF-H null mutation did not develop neurofilamentous swellings in motor neurons, unlike normal mouse littermates.

	abstract = {Neurofilaments are essential for establishment and maintenance of axonal diameter of large myelinated axons, a property that determines the velocity of electrical signal conduction. One prominent model for how neurofilaments specify axonal growth is that the 660–amino acid, heavily phosphorylated tail domain of neurofilament heavy subunit (NF-H) is responsible for neurofilament-dependent structuring of axoplasm through intra-axonal crossbridging between adjacent neurofilaments or to other axonal structures. To test such a role, homologous recombination was used to generate NF-H–null mice. In peripheral motor and sensory axons, absence of NF-H does not significantly affect the number of neurofilaments or axonal elongation or targeting, but it does affect the efficiency of survival of motor and sensory axons. Loss of NF-H caused only a slight reduction in nearest neighbor spacing of neurofilaments and did not affect neurofilament distribution in either large- or small-diameter motor axons. Since postnatal growth of motor axon caliber continues largely unabated in the absence of NF-H, neither interactions mediated by NF-H nor the extensive phosphorylation of it within myelinated axonal segments are essential features of this growth.},

Here, we develop a theory by systematically including the electrostatic interactions into the self-consistent field theory for polymers to study the conformational behaviors of a single PE in poor solvents. As the backbone charge fraction of the PE increases, our theory predicts that the spherical globule (Sph) can either be elongated to a series of pearl-necklace (PN) structures or be flattened to two novel structures that have not been reported before: biconcave red cell and toroid. While the PN structures are stable conformations, the two fattened structures are metastable. We find that the cylindrical globule, the stability of which is under debate, is an unstable structure. The signature of the PN structures obtained by our calculation is less pronounced than that reported by other theoretical works due to the continuous change in the curvature from the pearl to the necklace, which, however, is in good agreement with the results from molecular simulations and neutron scattering experiments. In addition, our theory reveals different characteristics of the globule to PN transition: the transition from the Sph to the PN with double pearls is discontinuous, whereas those from adjacent PN structures are continuous at finite salt concentrations. Furthermore, we observe different scaling behaviors: the string width is not a constant as a thermal blob but decays as the backbone charge fraction increases.},

A blood biomarker linked to neuronal injury would provide a critical measure to understand and treat neurologic diseases. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a cytoskeletal protein expressed only in neurons, has emerged as such a biomarker. With the ability to quantify neuronal damage in blood, NfL is being applied to a wide range of neurologic conditions to investigate and monitor disease including assessment of treatment efficacy. Blood NfL is not specific for one disease and its release can also be induced by physiological processes. Longitudinal studies in multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and stroke show accumulation of NfL over days followed by elevated levels over months. Therefore, it may be hard to determine with a single measurement when the peak of NfL is reached and when the levels are normalized. Nonetheless, measurement of blood NfL provides a new blood biomarker for neurologic diseases overcoming the invasiveness of CSF sampling that restricted NfL clinical application. In this review, we examine the use of blood NfL as a biologic test for neurologic disease.},

We collect strong evidence that the electrostatic interactions are a dominant force that controls the NF brush structure. There exists a remarkable spatial separation of the H, M, and L tails. In a dephosphorylated NF we found conﬁned and ﬂowerlike conformations for the H and M projection domains, respectively. We demonstrate that the ionization of KSP repeats in NF proteins triggers a conformational transition in the H tail that leads to the expulsion of its terminal (KEP) domain to the periphery of the NF brush. We argue that the phosphorylation of the NF proteins in axons can both increase the interﬁlament distance and stabilize cross bridges between neuroﬁlaments.},

Here, we review how NFs provide structural support for the highly asymmetric geometries of neurons and, especially, for the marked radial expansion of myelinated axons crucial for effective nerve conduction velocity. NFs in axons extensively cross-bridge and interconnect with other non-IF components of the cytoskeleton, including microtubules, actin filaments, and other fibrous cytoskeletal elements, to establish a regionally specialized network that undergoes exceptionally slow local turnover and serves as a docking platform to organize other organelles and proteins. We also discuss how a small pool of oligomeric and short filamentous precursors in the slow phase of axonal transport maintains this network. A complex pattern of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events on each subunit modulates filament assembly, turnover, and organization within the axonal cytoskeleton. Multiple factors, and especially turnover rate, determine the size of the network, which can vary substantially along the axon. NF gene mutations cause several neuroaxonal disorders characterized by disrupted subunit assembly and NF aggregation. Additional NF alterations are associated with varied neuropsychiatric disorders. New evidence that subunits of NFs exist within postsynaptic terminal boutons and influence neurotransmission suggests how NF proteins might contribute to normal synaptic function and neuropsychiatric disease states.},

Although they are present in perikarya and dendrites, neurofilaments are particularly abundant in axons, where they are essential for the radial growth of axons during development, the maintenance of axon caliber and the transmission of electrical impulses along axons, i.e. velocity of nerve conduction (Eyer and Peterson, 1994; Friede and Samorajski, 1970; Ohara et al., 1993; Yum et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 1997). In some pathological conditions, neurofilaments can accumulate in large numbers within cell bodies and proximal axons of affected neurons (Liu et al., 2009; Munoz et al., 1988). In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), these accumulations are a hallmark pathological lesion, but they are also prominent in sufferers of other neurological diseases, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, neurofilament inclusion disease (NFID), giant axonal neuropathy (GAN), diabetic neuropathy, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and spastic paraplegia, and are present in those people that suffer from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Abe et al., 2009; Perrot and Eyer, 2009; Szaro and Strong, 2010). Transgenic mouse models support the idea that these aberrant NF accumulations contribute to the death of the affected neurons, rather than simply being by-products of the pathogenic process (Côté et al., 1993; Couillard-Després et al., 1998; Williamson et al., 1998).

By increasing brush density, a stretched brush conformation is formed as a result of constraining the cross-sectional area of that brush strand which thereby inﬂuences the interactions of molecules with the brush surface. The associated residual stress also gives polymer brushes properties distinct from an equivalent layer of coated polymer chains.

	abstract = {Polymer brushes formed by identical macromolecules anchored at the solid-liquid interface may undergo conformational transitions resulting in formation of layered structures with abrupt variation of polymer density (”vertical stratification”) or in lateral decomposition that gives rise to nano-patterned interfaces. The intra-brush nanoscale segregation is governed by a balance of intermolecular interactions with conformational entropy of the brush-forming chains and may be triggered by external stimuli that affect the strength of the inter-chain interactions. Both vertical and lateral segregation in the brushes have important implication for applications of brushes for modification of physico-chemical and (bio)interactive properties of interfaces, as well as in biological functions of biopolymer brushes widely found in living nature. While the effects of microphase segregation in polymer brushes are well understood on the basis of existing theories, experimental observation and characterization of such structures using surface-sensitive techniques often remains challenging. Here we present an overview of the state-of-the-art in experimental work on high-resolution structural characterization of polymer brushes in relation to the existing theoretical predictions. The review focusses on planar and spherical brushes. Moreover, consequences for the related case of bottle brush polymers are discussed.},

Because the brush stimulus response resembles the ability of natural systems to react to environmental changes, responsive polymer brushes have been incorporated into a number of soft biomimetic structures. Nonetheless, the ability to design soft matter systems that recreate the complexity of life remains limited. Here, we survey the use of responsive surface-grafted polymer brushes to mimic biological function. We summarize various ways in which surface-grafted brushes respond to stimuli. Next, we highlight examples of biomimetic engineering that mimic specific biological structures, including molecular motors, ion channels, leukocytes, and leaves. Finally, we discuss recent studies that design brushes to generate lifelike behavior and interrogate their response under the non-equilibrium, spatiotemporally heterogeneous conditions in living systems. Specifically, we focus on hysteresis in the brush response, as one example of nonlinear response; slow diffusion, used by biological systems to maintain chemical gradients; self-oscillation, as an example of auto-amplification of stimuli; and patterned responsiveness, as an example of compartmentalization. This focus emphasizes the emerging need to rationally design the response of brushes for use as soft components in dynamic, life-inspired systems.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play central roles in numerous cellular processes. While IDP structure and function are often regulated by multisite phosphorylation, the biophysical mechanisms linking these post-translational modiﬁcations to IDP structure remain elusive. For example, the intrinsically disordered C-terminal sidearm domain of the neuroﬁlament heavy subunit (NFH-SA) forms a dense brush along axonal NF backbones and is subject to extensive serine phosphorylation. Yet, biophysical insight into the relationship between phosphorylation and structure has been limited by the lack of paradigms in which NF brush conformational responses can be measured in the setting of controlled phosphorylation. Here, we approach this question by immobilizing a recombinant NFH-SA (rNFH-SA) as IDP brushes onto glass, and controllably phosphorylating the sequence in situ with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK2) preactivated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK). We then monitor brush height changes using atomic force microscopy, which shows that phosphorylation induces signiﬁcant brush swelling to an extent that strongly depends upon pH and ionic strength, consistent with a mechanism in which phosphorylation regulates brush structure through local electrostatic interactions. Further consistent with this mechanism, the phosphorylated rNFH-SA brush may be dramatically condensed with micromolar concentrations of divalent cations. Phosphorylation-induced height changes are qualitatively reversible via alkaline phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation. Our study demonstrates that multisite phosphorylation controls NFH-SA structure through modulation of chain electrostatics and points to a general strategy for engineering IDP-based interfaces that can be reversibly and dynamically modulated by enzymes.},

In the absence of AlCl3 and at low AlCl3 concentrations monolayer adsorption is observed. With increasing AlCl3 concentration, surface multilayer formation is observed, driven by SLES/Al3+ complex formation. The onset of multilayer formation occurs initially as a single bilayer or a multilayer structure with a limited number of bilayers, N, ≤3, and ultimately at higher AlCl3 concentrations N is large, {\textgreater}20. The evolution in the surface structure is determined by the surfactant and AlCl3 concentrations, and the size of the polyethylene oxide group in the different SLES surfactants studied. From the NR data, approximate surface phase diagrams are constructed, and the evolution of the surface structure with surfactant and electrolyte concentration is shown to be dependent on the size of the polyethylene oxide group. As the polyethylene oxide group increases in size the multilayer formation requires increasingly higher surfactant and AlCl3 concentrations to promote the formation. This is attributed to the increased steric hindrance of the polyethylene oxide group disrupting SLES/Al3+ complex formation.},

	abstract = {We provide an in-depth study of pseudo-spectral numerical methods associated with modeling the self-assembly of molten mixed polymer brushes in the framework of self-consistent field theory (SCFT). SCFT of molten polymer brushes has proved numerically challenging in the past because of sharp features that arise in the self-consistent pressure field at the grafting surface due to the chain end tethering constraint. We show that this pressure anomaly can be reduced by smearing the grafting points over a narrow zone normal to the surface in an incompressible model, and/or by switching to a compressible model for the molten brush. In both cases, we use results obtained from a source (delta function) distribution of grafting points as a reference. At the grafting surface, we consider both Neumann and Dirichlet conditions, where the latter is paired with a masking method to mimic a confining surface. When only the density profiles and relative free energies of two comparison phases are of interest, either source or smeared distributions of grafting points can be used, but a smeared distribution of grafting points exhibits faster convergence with respect to the number of chain contour steps. Absolute free energies converge only within the smeared model. In addition, when a sine basis is used with the masking method and a smeared distribution, fewer iterations are necessary to converge the SCFT fields for the compressible model. The numerical methods described here and investigated in one-dimension will provide an enabling platform for computationally more demanding three-dimensional SCFT studies of a broad range of mixed polymer brush systems.},

Attempts at rationalizing the general principles underlying both conformational properties and transitions of IDPs/IDRs must consider the abundance of charged residues (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg) that typifies these proteins, rendering them assimilable to polyampholytes or polyelectrolytes. Their conformation strongly depends on both the charge density and distribution along the sequence (i.e., charge decoration) as highlighted by recent experimental and theoretical studies that have introduced novel descriptors. Published experimental data are revisited herein in the frame of this formalism, in a new and possibly unitary perspective. The physicochemical properties most directly affected by charge density and distribution are compaction and solubility, which can be described in a relatively simplified way by tools of polymer physics. Dissecting factors controlling such properties could contribute to better understanding complex biological phenomena, such as fibrillation and phase separation. Furthermore, this knowledge is expected to have enormous practical implications for the design, synthesis, and exploitation of bio-derived materials and the control of natural biological processes.},

The model simplifies the interactions between the NF core and the sidearm or between the sidearms by the sum of excluded volume, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions, where both monovalent salt ions and solvents are implicitly incorporated into the electrostatic interaction potential. Several important observations are made from the MC simulations of the coarse-grained model NF systems. First, the mean-field type description of monovalent salt ions works reasonably well in the NF system. Second, the manner by which the NF sidearms are arranged on the surface of the NF backbone core has little influence on the lateral extension of NF sidearms. Third, the lateral extension of the NF sidearms is highly affected by the ionic strength of the system: at low ionic strength, NF-M is most extended but at high ionic strength, NF-H is more stretched out because of the effective screening of the electrostatic interaction. Fourth, the presence of Ca2 + ions induces the attraction between negatively charged residues, which leads to the contraction of the overall NF extension. Finally, the introduction of hydrophobic interaction does not change the general structural organization of the NF sidearms except that the overall extension is contracted.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are an important and emerging class of materials for tailoring biointerfaces. While the importance of chain charge and resultant electrostatic interactions in controlling conformational properties of IDPs is beginning to be explored through in silico approaches, there is a dearth of experimental studies motivated toward a systematic study of these effects. In an effort to explore this relationship, we measured the conformations of two peptides derived from the intrinsically disordered neurofilament (NF) side arm domain: one depicting the wild-type sequence with four lysine–serine–proline repeats (KSP peptide) and another in which the serine residues were replaced with aspartates (KDP peptide), a strategy sometimes used to mimic phosphorylation. Using a variety of biophysical measurements including a novel application of scanning angle interference microscopy, we demonstrate that the KDP peptide assumes comparatively more expanded conformations in solution and forms significantly thicker brushes when immobilized on planar surfaces at high densities. In both settings, the peptides respond to changes in ambient ionic strength, with each peptide showing distinct stimulus-responsive characteristics. While the KDP peptide undergoes compaction with increasing ionic strength as would be expected for a polyampholyte, the KSP peptide shows biphasic behavior, with an initial compaction followed by an expanded state at a higher ionic strength. Together these results support the notion that modulation of charge on IDPs can regulate conformational and interfacial properties.},

	abstract = {Recently, we presented a strategy for packaging peptides as side-chains in high-density brush polymers. For this globular protein-like polymer (PLP) formulation, therapeutic peptides were shown to resist proteolytic degradation, enter cells efficiently and maintain biological function. In this paper, we establish the role charge plays in dictating the cellular uptake of these peptide formulations, finding that peptides with a net positive charge will enter cells when polymerized, while those formed from anionic or neutral peptides remain outside of cells. Given these findings, we explored whether cellular uptake could be selectively induced by a stimulus. In our design, a cationic peptide is appended to a sequence of charge-neutralizing anionic amino acids through stimuli-responsive cleavable linkers. As a proof-of-concept study, we tested this strategy with two different classes of stimuli, exogenous UV light and an enzyme (a matrix metalloproteinase) associated with the inflammatory response. The key finding is that these materials enter cells only when acted upon by the stimulus. This approach makes it possible to achieve delivery of the polymers, therapeutic peptides or an appended cargo into cells in response to an appropriate stimulus.},

Macroscopic frictional properties of brush surfaces were characterized by sliding a glass ball probe in water using a ball-on-plate type tribotester under the load of 0.1–0.49 N at the sliding velocity of 10−5–10−1 m s−1 at 298 K. A poly(DHMA) brush showed a relatively larger friction coefficient in water, whereas the polyelectrolyte brushes, such as poly(SPMK) and poly(MPC), revealed significantly low friction coefficients below 0.02 in water and in humid air conditions. A drastic reduction in the friction coefficient of polyelectrolyte brushes in aqueous solution was observed at around 10−3–10−2 m s−1 owing to the hydrodynamic lubrication effect, however, an increase in salt concentration in the aqueous solution led to the increase in the friction coefficients of poly(MTAC) and poly(SPMK) brushes. The poly(SPMK) brush showed a stable and low friction coefficient in water even after sliding over 450 friction cycles, indicating a good wear resistance of the brush film. © 2010 The Japan Chemical Journal Forum and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The pH-dependent chemical equilibrium of the monomer units provides a fine-tuning of the ionic transport though the nanopore by simply presetting the pH of the electrolyte solution. Our results demonstrate that this strategy enables a higher degree of control over the rectification properties when compared to the nanochannels modified with charged monolayer assemblies.

	abstract = {A major obstacle in the development of highly sensitive electrochemical biosensors is the issue of electrode fouling due to non-specific adsorption of biomolecules on the electrode/sensor surface. The efficacy of such systems is also limited by the need for high densities of immobilized bioactive molecules on the sensor surface. Biomolecules have a natural tendency to randomly adsorb on solid surfaces, which greatly reduces the bioefficiency and biofunctionality of sensing devices. Polymer brushes have recently attracted considerable interest for generating molecularly defined surfaces for applications in nanotechnology, molecular biology, and biomedical sciences. Two main advantages of using polymer brush systems are the ability to mitigate non-specific adsorption and the creation of tailor-made surfaces to control the immobilization of bioanalytes through specific receptor recognition interactions. The use of polymer brushes allows the formation of uniform surfaces with controlled chemical architecture that exhibits good chemical and thermal stability. In this highlight, we use recent examples to demonstrate the role of polymer brushes in the development of sensitive electrochemical biosensors with low detection limits.},

	abstract = {Polypeptoid-coated surfaces and many surface-grafted hydrophilic polymer brushes have been proven efficient in antifouling-the prevention of nonspecific biomolecular adsorption and cell attachment. Protein adsorption, in particular, is known to mediate subsequent cell-surface interactions. However, the detailed antifouling mechanism of polypeptoid and other polymer brush coatings at the molecular level is not well understood. Moreover, most adsorption studies focus only on measuring a single adsorbed mass value, and few techniques are capable of characterizing the hydrated in situ layer structure of either the antifouling coating or adsorbed proteins. In this study, interfacial assembly of polypeptoid brushes with different chain lengths has been investigated in situ using neutron reflection (NR). Consistent with past simulation results, NR revealed a common two-step structure for grafted polypeptoids consisting of a dense inner region that included a mussel adhesive-inspired oligopeptide for grafting polypeptoid chains and a highly hydrated upper region with very low polymer density (molecular brush). Protein adsorption was studied with human serum albumin (HSA) and fibrinogen (FIB), two common serum proteins of different sizes but similar isoelectric points (IEPs). In contrast to controls, we observed higher resistance by grafted polypeptoid against adsorption of the larger FIB, especially for longer chain lengths. Changing the pH to close to the IEPs of the proteins, which generally promotes adsorption, also did not significantly affect the antifouling effect against FIB, which was corroborated by atomic force microscopy imaging. Moreover, NR enabled characterization of the in situ hydrated layer structures of the polypeptoids together with proteins adsorbed under selected conditions. While adsorption on bare SiO2 controls resulted in surface-induced protein denaturation, this was not observed on polypeptoids. Our current results therefore highlight the detailed in situ view that NR may provide for characterizing protein adsorption on polymer brushes as well as the excellent antifouling behavior of polypeptoids.},

The copolymers were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and 1H NMR spectroscopies. Thiol-terminated, PPgMAMPC-SH, obtained by aminolysis of PPgMAMPC, was immobilized on a gold-coated substrate using a “grafting to” approach via self-assembly. Azide-containing species, namely, biotin and peptide nucleic acid (PNA), were then immobilized on the alkyne-containing copolymeric platform via CuAAC. The potential use of surface-attached PPgMAMPC in biosensing applications was shown by detection of specific target molecules, i.e., streptavidin (SA) and DNA, by the developed sensing platform using a surface plasmon resonance technique. The copolymer composition strongly influenced the performance of the developed sensing platform in terms of signal-to-noise ratio in the case of the biotin–SA system and hybridization efficiency and mismatch discrimination for the PNA–DNA system.},

The absence of NF-L protein in mice resulted in dramatic declines of ≈20-fold in the levels of neurofilament medium and heavy proteins in the brain and sciatic nerve while increases were detected for other cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and GAP-43. Despite a lack of neurofilaments and hypotrophy of axons, the NF-L knockout mice develop normally and do not exhibit overt phenotypes. However, in both NF-L −/− and NF-L +/− mice, the regeneration of myelinated axons following crush injury of peripheral nerves was found to be abnormal. In the second week after axotomy, the number of newly regenerated myelinated axons in the sciatic nerve and facial nerve of NF-L −/− mice corresponded to only ≈25 and ≈5\% of the number of myelinated axons found in normal mice, respectively. At this early postaxotomy stage, electron microscopy of nerve segments distal to the crush site in NF-L −/− mice revealed abundant clusters of axonal sprouts that were indicative of retarded maturation of regenerating fibers. The analysis of the distal sciatic nerve at 2 months after crush indicated that neurofilament-deficient axons have the capacity to regrow for a long distance and to remyelinate, albeit at a slower rate. These results provide the first direct evidence for a role of neurofilaments in the maturation of regenerating myelinated axons.},

Intermediate filaments, so named because their 10-nanometer diameter is intermediate between that of microfilaments (6 nanometers) and microtubules (23 nanometers), assemble into an anastomosed network within the cytoplasm. In combination with a recently identified class of cross-linking proteins that mediate interactions between intermediate filaments and the other cytoskeletal networks, evidence is reviewed here that intermediate filaments provide a flexible intracellular scaffolding whose function is to structure cytoplasm and to resist stresses externally applied to the cell. Mutations that weaken this structural framework increase the risk of cell rupture and cause a variety of human disorders.},

Construction and mechanical unfolding of cysteine-engineered polyproteins with controlled linkage topology allows measuring intramolecular distance with angstrom precision. We demonstrate the potential of this technique by determining the position of three residues in the structure of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Our results perfectly agree with the GFP crystal structure. Mechanical triangulation can find many applications where current bulk structural methods fail.},

The force spectra revealed the individuality of the unfolding pathways. Helices G and F as well as helices E and D always unfolded pairwise, whereas helices B and C occasionally unfolded one after the other. Experiments with cleaved loops revealed the origin of the individuality: stabilization of helix B by neighboring helices.},

This suggests that a common underlying physical framework might govern the formation of functionally and compositionally unrelated biomolecular condensates. In this review, we summarize recent work that leverages a stickers-and-spacers framework adapted from the field of associative polymers for understanding how multivalent protein and RNA molecules drive phase transitions that give rise to biomolecular condensates. We discuss how the valence of stickers impacts the driving forces for condensate formation and elaborate on how stickers can be distinguished from spacers in different contexts. We touch on the impact of sticker- and spacer-mediated interactions on the rheological properties of condensates and show how the model can be mapped to known drivers of different types of biomolecular condensates.},

Surface force isotherms were measured for different molecular architectures. The temperature dependence of the film thickness was also studied. The observed interaction force is predominantly repulsive and nearly elastic and can be described by polymer−brush scaling theory. Comparisons between polymer−polymer and polymer−hard-wall compression isotherms show a significant interpenetration of the two polymer films.},

We measured force−distance profiles with the surface force apparatus (SFA) for several polyelectrolyte brushes of different lengths as a function of aqueous 1:1 electrolyte concentration. Long-ranged electrostatic double-layer forces were not observed in the force curves, and our results suggest that more counterions than predicted by the Manning theory are condensed onto the polymer backbones inside the brush. The brush height observed with the SFA follows the predictions of the mean field theory:  at low ionic strength the height is independent of the external salt concentration cs, whereas at high external ionic strength the height shrinks with a weak power law L0 ∝ cs-1/3. All force vs separation data for three different brushes, with various salt concentrations, collapse with reasonable accuracy into two reduced plots of data in the osmotic and salted brush regimes, respectively, the variables of which are developed in the scope of the mean-field brush theory.},

Here, we develop a molecular theory by systematically incorporating the self-consistent field theory for charged macromolecules into the dilute solution thermodynamics. The kinetic pathway is tracked without any restriction on the morphology of the aggregates. We find that protein aggregation at low salt concentrations is via a two-step nucleated process involving a conformational transition from metastable spherical oligomer to elongated fibril. The scaling analysis elucidates the electrostatic origin of the conformational transition: the fibril enters the screening region much earlier than the spherical aggregate. As salt concentration increases, the classical mode of one-step nucleation corresponding to macroscopic liquid-liquid phase separation is recovered. Our results reveal that the screened electrostatic interaction is essential for the existence of the metastable oligomer and its subsequent conformational transition to fibril. The theoretical predictions of the kinetic pathway and the morphology of the aggregates are in good agreement with the experimental observations of real proteins.},

Here, we theoretically investigate the classical problem of the conformation of a single homogeneous PE in salt solutions. We predict the formation of a stable vesicle structure at intermediate salt concentrations which is beyond the well-accepted framework of globule to pearl-necklace transition. The vesicle formed by a single PE is electrostatic in origin where salt ions play the role of surfactant. We demonstrate that the transitions from vesicle to both spherical globule and pearl-necklace are discontinuous; the latter involves a two-step nucleation with an intermediate vesicle-necklace state. We also calculate the full diagram of state and show the existence of a critical quadruple point that is uniquely determined for PE with a given chain length. The vesicle structure can be well-controlled by the external salt concentration, which facilitates the design of ionic-responsive single-chain nanoparticles.},

The structure of a globule and its melting thermodynamics is examined using the self-consistent filed theory. Our results show that the chain conformation involves three states prior to the globule-to-coil transition: the fully collapsed globule, the swollen globule, and the molten globule, which are distinguished by the core density and the interfacial thickness. By examining the chain-length dependence of the melting of the swollen globule, we find universal scaling behavior in the chain properties near the Θ point. The information on density profile and free energy of the globule is used in the dilute solution thermodynamics to study the phase equilibrium of polymer solution. Our results show different scaling behavior of the solubility of polymers in the dilute solution compared to the F–H theory, both in the χ dependence and in the chain-length dependence. From the perspectives of single chain structure and solution thermodynamics, our results verify the consistency of the Θ point defined by different criteria in the limit of infinite chain length: the disappearance of the effective two-body interaction, the abrupt change in chain size, and the critical point in the phase diagram of the polymer solution. Our results show χΘ = 0.5 (for the case of equal monomer and solvent volume), which coincides with the value predicted from the F–H theory.},
